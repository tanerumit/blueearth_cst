"""Record the config an artifact-scoped workflow ran under, beside the artifact.

WF0-WF2 are singletons per project, so each writes one overwritable record
under ``config/runs/<workflow>/``. WF3 and WF4 are not: a project holds one
directory per scenario collection and one per experiment, so a single
``config/runs/<workflow>/`` slot would be claimed by whichever ran last and
would describe the others wrongly. Their snapshot therefore lives INSIDE the
identified directory, which is the only placement that stays true when a
second collection is generated.

**The snapshot is UNREFERENCED on purpose.** ``simulation_id`` and
``collection_id`` hash digests and never path strings, and neither
``simulation.json`` nor ``collection.json`` carries a directory listing -- so a
file the identity documents do not name changes no identity and invalidates no
retained metric set. Recording these fields INSIDE ``collection_intent.json``
or ``simulation.json`` would have been the tidier shape, and would have
rewritten every existing experiment's identity to buy provenance. It would also
fail closed rather than silently: ``read_simulation`` compares the record's key
set against an exact expected set and raises on any extra field.

What it closes, none of which the digest documents carried:

* **which SOURCE file the settings came from**, and whether it has changed
  since. The collection records the resolved VALUES -- which is the stronger
  fact for reproducing numbers -- but nothing anywhere in the scenario or
  experiment trees named the file they were resolved from, so the audit
  question "is this still the config that produced it?" had no answer;
* **``operation:``**, a WF4 config key that reached no record at all;
* a view in the same vocabulary and format as the source config, rather than
  settings split across two JSON provenance documents in a different one.

It is a RECORD, not a re-run button. The collection also depends on the staged
forcing and the generator template, which ``source_inventory.json`` pins by
sha256 and this file does not carry -- the same limit the WF1 snapshot has.
