the same aggregation can back a model-independent climate-analysis component

def climate_forcing_by_subcatchment(forcing, subcatchment):
    """Spatial-mean the wflow forcing per subcatchment -> ``(index, time)`` dataset.

    The climate variables plotted by ``plot_clim`` come from the model's climate
    **input** (the ERA5-derived ``inmaps`` forcing: ``precip``/``temp``/``pet``),
    not from wflow outputs (ADR 0002). Each variable is reduced to a per-
    subcatchment spatial mean timeseries so it can be plotted per station.

    Parameters
    ----------
    forcing : xr.Dataset
        wflow forcing (``inmaps``) with variables ``precip``, ``temp``, ``pet``
        on the model grid (a spatial ``(latitude, longitude)`` pair plus
        ``time``).
    subcatchment : xr.DataArray
        wflow ``subcatchment`` staticmap on the same grid; each cell holds its
        integer subcatchment id, with a nodata value (``_FillValue``, 0 in the
        current build) outside the basin.

    Returns
    -------
    xr.Dataset
        Variables ``P_subcatchment`` / ``T_subcatchment`` / ``EP_subcatchment``
        with dims ``(index, time)``; ``index`` is the integer subcatchment id,
        matching the discharge-station index. Consumed directly by ``plot_clim``.

    Notes
    -----
    The spatial reduction is an **unweighted** cell mean (matching the
    ``plot_forcing`` precedent). Fine for small equatorial basins; for
    higher-latitude or large basins, cell-area weighting would be more accurate.
