# --- series keys (migration step 3; design §5.2, §5.3) ------------------------
# One stage-A rule fans out over {series_key} instead of two rules fanning out
# over {model} and {model}×{scenario}. The key is built here and looked up by the
# rule, NEVER parsed back out of the wildcard: `/` is sanitized to `_` and CMIP6
# model names contain both `-` and `_` (`NOAA-GFDL/GFDL-ESM4`), so splitting a key
# on `_` cannot recover (model, experiment) unambiguously.
#
# The key omits the member at this step. Under the step-3 scope decision the
# `members:` config list is still looped INSIDE one job, so a single series covers
# every member and a key naming one of them would be a lie; the members it covers
# are recorded in `cst_members`. Step 4 makes the member a wildcard alongside the
# §5.7 resolution ladder that gives per-member fan-out meaning, and appends
# `_{member}` to the grammar then. Two renames of an unmanifested intermediate is
# the price of not regressing multi-member configs for a step.
# --- source resolution (migration step 4a; design §5.7, D6, D7, D12) ----------
# Which requested combinations can actually be reduced, decided HERE at DAG build
# from a plain YAML read -- no hydromt import, no network. Unresolved combinations
# never become jobs, which is what lets the dummy-empty-netCDF pattern and

#
# Absence and failure are different classes (design §4 criterion 7): almost every
# non-resolution is a NORMAL skip recorded for the composition record, because
# under R3' a model publishing no ssp370, or one member where another publishes
# three, is the expected shape of a correct run. Only two conditions stop the DAG

# rule's position in this workflow's LOGICAL order — data, then the product,
# then figures and records. Contiguous, and every dependency points from a lower
# number to a higher one. Positional since [R10-5] (2026-08-06); this file is
# where the old scheme showed worst, defining its rules 2.00, 2.03b, 2.03, 2.01,
# 2.02, 2.04, 2.06, 2.07 — numbers out of order against the DAG.
#
# STILL A READING AID, NOT EXECUTION ORDER — stage A fans out over {series_key},
# so low-to-high says "cannot depend on", not "runs before". Definition order in
# this file is not the number order and is not required to be.
#
# DO NOT RENUMBER TO INSERT A RULE. Use a letter suffix (2.05b) until the next
# deliberate sweep. Convention: dev/reference/naming.md §9; full map:
# dev/reference/workflows/rule-index.md § What changed.

# --- log layout ---------------------------------------------------------------
# EVERY WF2 rule that logs writes a PART under logs/_parts/, and rule 2.09 merges
# the parts into ONE logs/wf2_analyze_projections.log, then deletes them. So the
# only WF2 file left in logs/ after a full run is that merged log — the same deal
# benchmarks/wf2_benchmarks.md already gets from `gather_benchmarks`.
#
# LOG_RULES is the merge order: rule LABELS, not part paths. merge_logs lists
# each label's part dir to find its members, so the fan-out width lives in one
# place — the rule that owns it. Naming the labels rather than globbing `_parts/`
# is what keeps an orphan dir from a renamed rule out of the file (test_local
# still holds `2.02_monthly_stats_hist`, `2.03_monthly_stats_fut`,
# `2.04_monthly_change` from the pre-step-4d names, and now the whole pre-R10
# generation besides): not a label, never read.
#
# ORDER IS BY RULE NUMBER, and since [R10-5] that is also dependency order, so
# this list needed no reordering to satisfy the assertion
# tests/test_log_rules_contract.py now makes — it was already in EXECUTION
# order, and the renumber is what made the two agree. Before it this file's
# comment claimed "order is by rule number" while the list opened 2.03b, 2.01,
# 2.02; which of the two was wrong was a ruling nobody had made, and it is why
# the assertion was deferred to this sweep.
#
# Each section carries its own timestamps, so chronology stays readable inside a
# section. 2.01 snapshot_config declares no `log:`, and neither gather rule does.
#
# TWO INSTANCES OF ONE DEFECT ARE FIXED HERE. The region rule was missing from
# this list -- it is splatted into all three workflows from ONE producer
# contract, but each workflow owns its own `log:` label and its own LOG_RULES,
# so registering it is a per-file obligation the shared definition does not
# carry, and it was missed in all three files in turn. And a store label
# outlived the rule ADR 0003 §5 deleted, contributing a phantom "no part from
# this run" section to every merged WF2 log. WF2 builds no climate store,
# standalone or otherwise: it reads the region polygon from `delineate_region`.

# `gather_raw_logs` 2.08). Those merged only the fan-out rules, each into its own
# logs/2.NN_<rule>.log, while the four single-job rules wrote their logs straight
# to logs/ — so following one run meant opening five files and knowing their
# order. One workflow log with `==` rule banners is the same information in
# reading order.
#
# `input:` is the terminal artifact set (identical to `gather_benchmarks`), which
# is what schedules this LAST: every logging rule is upstream of it. The parts
# themselves stay in `params:` — they are `log:` files, and Snakemake does not
# track those in the DAG, so naming them as `input:` would demand them as
# buildable targets.
#
# The merge DELETES the parts it consumed and prunes the emptied dirs, so a clean
# full run leaves no logs/_parts/ at all. Consequence to know: after a PARTIAL
# re-run only the re-run rules have parts, so the merged log rewrites with the
# untouched sections marked "no part from this run" rather than resurrecting text
# it no longer has. That is the same trade `merge_benchmarks` already makes
# (dev/followups-archive.md R7-9) — the artifact describes the run that produced it, not
# an accumulated history.
