"""Unit tests for the `--workflow` scope filter on check_baseline.py.

The filter (design ext1-1/ext2-1) tags each `TARGETS` entry with its owning
workflow. On `check --workflow`, it builds ONE selected path universe and applies
it symmetrically to both the recorded manifest and the current on-disk targets
before the missing/diff/orphan/count logic. On `record --workflow` (added for
ADR 0001 step 7), it records ONLY the selected workflow(s) and MERGES into the
existing manifest — the other workflows' rows are preserved, never clobbered — so
a wf1-slice re-record does not drag in a wf2/wf3 run.

The fixture builds a synthetic project dir under `tmp_path` with a valid file for
every real `TARGETS` template (including the workflow-1 discharge `output.csv`),
then records a manifest against it via `cmd_record` — the same code path the tool
uses, so path keys match `resolve()` byte-for-byte and the discharge reference
series lands under `<manifest_dir>/discharge_ref/`. No real Snakemake run.
