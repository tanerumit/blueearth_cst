# `import hydromt` is GONE, not deferred: its comment claimed a `.raster.vars`
# "below", and this file contains no `.raster` access at all. What it actually
# registered the accessor for is `derive_change_factors`, which does read
# `.raster.vars` and imports this module -- a side effect travelling through an
# import chain rather than being asked for. That module also imports
# `get_change_climate_proj_summary`, which imports hydromt at module scope with
# its own `.raster.vars` use, so the accessor is still registered before
# anything in the chain runs; a fresh-process probe confirms it. Making
# `derive_change_factors` ask for it itself is filed separately -- this file has
# no `.raster` access to guarantee anything for.
#
# pandas and xarray are DEFERRED into the three functions that use them.
# `analyze_projections.smk` imports this module at PARSE time so `STAGE_B_KERNEL`
# can hold the FUNCTION OBJECTS for `kernel_hash`; the objects are required, the
# numeric stack is not.

# NOTE: this module no longer runs as a Snakemake `script:`. Step 4d merged rules
# 2.04/2.05 into `derive_change_factors`, which imports the functions above and
# owns the orchestration. The former `__main__` block is deleted rather than left
# dead: it was a second copy of the per-point procedure, and two copies of the
# same arithmetic is how they drift apart. The functions stay here — they are the
# tested surface (tests/test_get_change_climate_proj*.py).
