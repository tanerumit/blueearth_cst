"""Resolve the names hydromt_wflow gave the user's gauges.

``output_locations`` is a PATH in our config, but by the time the model exists
the gauges live under names hydromt_wflow chose, and those names are not the
filename. ``setup_gauges`` normalizes the basename
(``hydromt_wflow/wflow_base.py``)::

    basename = os.path.basename(gauges_fn).split(".")[0].replace("_", "-")

so ``output_locations.csv`` becomes ``output-locations`` in every derived name:
the staticgeoms layer ``gauges_output-locations``, the wflow TOML's ``map``, and
the parsed output columns ``Q_gauges_output-locations`` /
``P_gauges_output-locations``.

Three readers derived those names from the FILENAME instead, missed the
underscore-to-hyphen step, and — because each lookup was a membership test used
as a guard (``if name in geoms:``) — dropped the user's gauges in SILENCE.
Observed 2026-08-01 on a real basin: gauges absent from ``basin_area.png``, no
gauge hydrographs, no signature plots, and an EMPTY ``performance_metrics.csv``,
while ``output.csv`` carried all four stations correctly because wflow reads the
TOML rather than guessing.

This module is the single place that answers "what are the gauges called?", and
it answers by ASKING THE MODEL rather than by re-deriving the name. Mirroring
``replace("_", "-")`` in three places would fix today's symptom and re-break the
day ``setup_gauges`` is called with an explicit ``basename=`` (it accepts one)
or upstream changes the rule. Discovery is indifferent to both.

The second half of the lesson is the silence, not the name. A configured gauges
file whose layer cannot be found is now a loud WARNING naming what was looked
for and what exists — never a skip. It is a warning rather than an error
because absence is legitimately possible: ``setup_gauges`` returns early, having
logged "Skipping method, as no data has been found", when no gauge falls inside
the model domain.
