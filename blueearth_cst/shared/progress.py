"""In-place progress reporting for the long dask computes a rule waits on.

Replaces ``dask.diagnostics.ProgressBar`` wherever a rule blocks on one big
graph, so every workflow's long write animates the same labelled line:

* wf0's climate-store write and wf2's series write call :class:`DaskProgress`
  directly, as a dask ``Callback``;
* wf1's and wf3's writes go through hydromt, which hard-codes
  ``progressbar=True`` and offers no way in for a caller's bar --
  :func:`hydromt_progress` rebinds the name hydromt resolves;
* rule 1.08 drives hydromt through its CLI, so the bar is drawn in a child
  process no rebind can reach -- :class:`DaskFrameRelay` re-renders the frames
  arriving on the pipe.

Same mechanism as dask's bar -- one line redrawn in place -- with three things
dask's does not give:

* **a label**, so a console running several sources says WHICH one is writing;
* an **ETA**, which is the number someone watching a multi-minute write wants;
* a **final frame that reads as a summary**, because the tee keeps exactly that
  one line in the rule log (``_cr_overwrite`` collapses every redraw to the
  last non-empty segment).

Three constraints shape the implementation, and each one rules out an
off-the-shelf bar:

* **No ANSI, ever.** The tee writes ONE string to both the console and the log
  file, so an escape code emitted here lands in ``logs/`` -- the defect fixed
  on 2026-08-14 when the start banner stopped colouring its own fields. Colour
  is the caller's business and there is no caller that can add it safely here.
* **Not a TTY at run time.** Under Snakemake a ``script:`` rule's stdout is the
  tee, whose ``isatty()`` is False by design. ``rich`` disables live rendering
  on a non-TTY, which would silently reduce the bar to nothing on every real
  run; both it and ``tqdm`` are also only transitively present in the env, so
  using either means a new declared dependency for a progress bar.
* **cp1252 consoles exist.** A Windows console that cannot encode ``\u2501``
  gets the ASCII rendering instead of mojibake -- the same reason
  :func:`snake_utils.rule_message` is ASCII-only. The probe reads the real
  stream's encoding, since the tee exposes none of its own.

Redraws are throttled and driven by task completion rather than by a timer
thread: a thread would interleave its writes with the rule's own logging on a
sink that makes no thread-safety promise, and a stalled compute is already
covered by the silence-triggered heartbeat in ``snake_utils``.

        bar is open, ``still running, 1m00s elapsed`` states in a second grammar
        the one fact the bar's own clock already carries -- and it states it by
        writing a row onto the line the bar is sitting on. Redrawing instead
        keeps the elapsed time moving inside the line that is already there.

        This is what covers the two windows Wflow leaves silent: the package
        load and JIT before the first timestep, and the ~45 s
        ``Wflow.Model(config)`` construction, neither of which is instrumented
        upstream. Both are why WF3 beeped where WF1 looked fine -- WF1 runs the
        model once, WF3 once per batch member.
