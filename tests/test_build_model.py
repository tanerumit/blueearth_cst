    R07 B9 replaced the single derived ``output_dir`` with explicit per-file
    routing. The config-snapshot redesign (2026-08-13) then made the COPY
    itself conditional: a file inside the checkout, tracked and clean, is
    recorded by its git blob id instead, because duplicating what version
    control already holds serves nobody.

    Hermetic on ``tmp_path``, not the shared ``project_dir`` fixture. The
    previous version asserted both tracked files WERE copied and passed locally
    for a reason unrelated to the code: ``tests/test_project/`` is untracked and
    persists between runs, so copies made before the predicate existed were
    still lying there. CI builds a fresh tree and the test failed there and only
    there -- the exact "green locally, red on the other leg" shape this repo has
    been bitten by before.
