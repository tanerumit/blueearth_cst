def tee_to_log(log_path, heartbeat_interval=60.0):
    """Tee ``sys.stdout``/``sys.stderr`` to ``log_path`` for a ``script:`` rule.

    Snakemake does not auto-redirect ``script:`` output to the rule's ``log:``
    (unlike ``shell:`` rules), so a script wraps its body in this manager and
    passes ``snakemake.log[0]``.

    Contract (R3 design §6):
    - creates ``log_path`` and any missing parent directories;
    - both streams are restored in a ``finally`` — the redirection cannot leak
      past the ``with`` block even if the body raises;
    - the exception is **re-raised** (not swallowed), so the traceback still
      reaches Snakemake and the rule fails loudly rather than leaving an empty
      log that Snakemake would read as a finished product.

    A silence watchdog (``_Heartbeat``) prints an elapsed-time notice to the
    live console when the rule goes quiet for ``heartbeat_interval`` seconds, so
    a stalled job is visible while it runs. It writes to the console only — the
    log file never receives a heartbeat line. ``CST_HEARTBEAT_SECS`` overrides
    the interval (``0`` disables it).

    Library logging bound to the console before entry (hydromt's ``StreamHandler``
    on ``sys.stdout``) is repointed through the tee for the duration, so its
    records get the same compacted ``HH:MM:SS - <module> - <LEVEL> - <msg>`` form
    and land in the log file instead of bypassing it (see
    ``_redirect_console_log_handlers``).

    Parameters
    ----------
    log_path : str | os.PathLike
        Destination log file. Callers pass the rule's unique
        ``snakemake.log[0]`` so concurrent jobs never share a path.
    heartbeat_interval : float
        Seconds of silence before the console heartbeat fires (default 60).
