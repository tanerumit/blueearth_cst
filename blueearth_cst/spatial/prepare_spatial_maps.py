"""Snakemake entry point for Workflow 1's thematic spatial map stack.

The RASTER half of ADR 0003 §8, and WF1 only: it exists to parameterise Wflow.
The vector layers and the location registry it used to produce alongside
``spatial_maps.nc`` now come from rule ``delineate_subbasins_and_rivers``, which all
three workflows declare — this rule consumes them, adds the LULC/LAI/soil
layers, and writes the catalog and report.
