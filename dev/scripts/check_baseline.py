"""Record / check fingerprints for the M1 replication baseline.

Walks the formal `rule all` targets across the three Snakefiles and writes
a JSON manifest under dev/baseline/. Fingerprint format follows the
roadmap and the pipeline-regression-testing skill: per-variable summary
stats for netCDF, normalized SHA256 for CSV/YAML, size-only for PNG.

One target is special: the workflow-1 Wflow **discharge** series
(`models/hydrology/wflow/run_default/output.csv`).

**Produce the run with `--notemp`.** Since 2026-08-10 rule 1.14 declares that
file as `temp()`, so an ordinary run deletes it once rules 1.14b and 1.15 have
consumed it and this target then fails "target missing on disk" — a gate
failure that indicates no defect. The derived `output_q.csv` beside it is NOT a
substitute: it is rounded to 5 decimal places, and on discharge running
1e-5..1e-1 that is around three significant figures, coarser than the drift the
tolerance comparator below exists to detect.

It is NOT a `rule all` target of
build_model.smk (whose `rule all` lists only the 3 PNGs + config
snapshot + outlet_index.csv); it is fingerprinted beyond `rule all` for
constant-parameter-preservation coverage (ADR 0001, t260719a). A byte-hash is
wrong for it: raw daily discharge is full float64 and maximally LSB-sensitive,
so an exact hash fails on any solver/env drift and a match cannot be attributed
to a config change. Instead `record` stores a reduced reference series (time
index + Q column) under dev/baseline/discharge_ref/, and `check` runs a
time-index-aligned numeric comparator (ADR step 6): structural checks, then a
per-timestep absolute+relative tolerance. The SAME comparator (`compare_discharge`)
is exposed via the `compare` subcommand for the one-off restored-vs-reference and
reproducibility comparisons (ADR steps 4b/5), so reproducibility, materiality, and
the durable regression check cannot disagree.

The wf3 **indicator tables** are the second such target (type "indicator", R11
Q8). Same reason, arrived at from the other direction: they used to be
byte-hashable only because they were rounded, and P1 dropped the rounding as part
of moving them to a long float32 shape. `record` stores a reference copy of the
table under dev/baseline/indicator_ref/ and `check` aligns the two on their row
keys and applies a per-group absolute+relative tolerance. Grouped, not global,
because one long table stacks metrics in different units and gauges of different
catchment areas -- a single file-wide mean would let the biggest series set the
threshold for the smallest.

**Mixed-provenance baseline (ADR 0001 t260719a, immaterial branch).** Since the
constant-parameter restoration the wf1 slice reflects the RESTORED model, while the
wf2/wf3 rows are the pre-restoration recording (the restored discharge move was
immaterial — 0/7670 timesteps over tolerance — so wf3 was deliberately not re-run).
**RESIDUAL TESTED AND CLOSED 2026-08-05.** This used to warn that a future wf3
regen + `check` MAY fail the byte-exact q_indicators/basin_indicators fingerprints
if the sub-tolerance wf1 move (max|dQ|/mean ~ 1.7e-4) survived their rounding, and
to follow the ADR 0001 step-7 immaterial-branch path if it did. It has now been
run. A wf3 regen from the RESTORED model reproduced both tables byte-identically
below the header: the only fingerprint movement was the R9-followup rename of the
perturbation-axis columns (tavg/prcp -> temp_change/precip_change), proven by
reverting the header line alone and recovering both recorded sha256 exactly, with
both sizes moving by exactly +16 bytes -- the header delta and nothing else. So
the wf1 delta demonstrably does NOT propagate into the wf3 reduction, and the wf3
slice is no longer mixed-provenance in any way that matters: it was re-recorded
from main@03e546c on those same numbers.
Evidence: dev/milestones/r09/migration_indicator-axis-columns.md §5;
dev/decisions/0001-restore-wflow-constant-parameters/baseline_diffs.md.
(That paragraph describes the world before R11: both tables were byte-hashed and
`basin_indicators.csv` still existed. Kept as written because it is the record of
how the residual was closed, not a description of the current gate.)

# ruled these targets onto "check_baseline.py's existing compare_discharge-style
# tolerance comparator". The one real difference is that a discharge target is a
# SINGLE series with one meaningful magnitude, while an indicator table stacks
# many series -- metrics in different units, gauges with different catchment
# areas -- into one long table. So the tolerance is derived per group rather than
# once for the file. Everything else (structural-checks-first, ATOL from the
# reference's own mean, RTOL as a large-value tightener, division-safe skip
# below ATOL) is the same rule.
