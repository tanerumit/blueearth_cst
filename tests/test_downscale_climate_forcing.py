"""[R7-22] Unit coverage for `downscale_climate_forcing`'s extracted helpers.

The module used to run its whole body at import inside `with tee_to_log(...)`,
so none of this was reachable from a test. The conversion moved the body into
`downscale_climate_forcing(...)` and pulled three decisions out as pure
functions; those three are what a test can actually pin without a wflow model,
a data catalog and a forcing netCDF.

`forcing_window` has since moved to its own light module -- WF3's Snakefile
needs it at parse time to size batches against the disk, and cannot pay this
module's `hydromt_wflow` import to get it. It is still rule 3.14's window, so
its tests stay here; only the import moved.

The end-to-end path stays covered where it always was -- the workflow contract
tests and a real run -- not here.
