"""R07 O-24 / O-08: wf1's figure outputs are declared, and the sentinel is read.

* ``test_delete_all_output_removes_the_declared_plot_outputs`` — O-24. Before
  R07, rule 1.13 wrote three PNGs and declared one, and rule 1.11 wrote
  ``performance_metrics.csv`` and declared
  none of them; undeclared outputs survive ``--delete-all-output`` and are
  invisible to the baseline.

  That claim USED to be scoped to configs without extra gauges, because the
  per-station sheets stayed undeclared: their count is the model's
  outlet/subcatchment count, a build product unknown at parse time. Since
  2026-08-18 (t2608071206) rule 1.15 declares the ``plots/stations/`` bin as a
  ``directory()``, so they are reachable too and the scope caveat is gone. The
  control file below moved with it — it has to be something still genuinely
  undeclared, or the assertion stops discriminating.

  (The docstring named a third family, ``clim_{station}_{period}.png``. It has
  not existed since ADR 0006 removed it on 2026-08-09.)

* ``test_delete_all_output_removes_a_basavg_figure`` — the half of O-24 that
  IS derivable. ``plot_basavg``'s PNGs are a pure function of
  ``wflow_outvars``, so rule 1.11 declares them (2026-08-01); this proves the
  derivation reaches ``--delete-all-output`` for a config that has one, and the
  seed config (``wflow_outvars: ["river discharge"]``) still declares none.

* ``test_gauges_layer_name_*`` — O-08. An unquoted ``output_locations: None``
  is YAML for the Python **string** ``"None"``. The pre-R07 guard tested only
  ``is not None`` and derived the layer name ``gauges_None``, which can never
  exist in ``geoms`` — so the gauges were dropped silently rather than
  deliberately. The shipped configs moved to a real ``null`` in 2026-08, but the
  string stays tolerated for project configs still carrying it, so both
  spellings must keep resolving to "unset".
