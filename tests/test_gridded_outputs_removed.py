"""S8-08(c): the gridded outputs, and both spellings of their config key, are gone.

`save_grids` was renamed to `save_gridded` at 5e (OQ-12); S8-08(c) removed the
feature outright. The reason the option was never worth its branch:
`raw/{series_key}.nc` already IS the basin slice on the source grid, and for an
`Amon` source the monthly resample between it and `grids/series/` is the identity
— so the gridded series would have been a near-copy of a file every run writes.
`grids/change/` was the only genuinely new artifact and no rule ever declared it.

This file replaces the old-key-raises test with a **removal** test. The asymmetry
it pins is deliberate: a `true` raises, because silently handing back `false`
behaviour is the exact failure the 5e rename existed to prevent; a `false` warns
and continues, because it asks for precisely what the workflow now always does.
