"""Merge a workflow's per-rule log parts into ONE log for the whole workflow.

Every logging rule writes its log under ``<logs>/_parts/<W.NN>_<rule>[/<member>].log``.
This gather step -- one job per workflow, scheduled after every logging rule --
concatenates those parts, in rule order, into a single ``<logs>/<workflow>.log``,
then deletes the parts it merged. All five workflows use it; examples:

=========================== ==================================================
``build_model.smk``         ``logs/wf1_build_model.log`` (1.17)
``analyze_projections.smk`` ``logs/wf2_analyze_projections.log`` (2.09)
``simulate_system.smk``    ``logs/wf4_simulate_system_<experiment>.log`` (4.11)
=========================== ==================================================

Shape of the merged file (the same pattern ``merge_benchmarks.py`` applies to the
benchmark tables):

- ONE provenance header at the top, from ``snake_utils._log_header_lines``. The
  per-part headers are **stripped**: a near-identical three-line block repeated
  once per rule was the bulk of the old merged file and none of its information.
- One ``==`` banner per rule, carrying the same ``W.NN  name`` tag the live
  console announces (``console_style.rule_banner``), so a section is greppable by
  the number it ran under.
- One ``--`` sub-header per member of a fan-out rule (WF2's ``{series_key}``,
  WF3's ``rlz_N_st_M`` / ``batch_N``) -- those are the parts a reader has to tell
  apart, and the member id is what the stripped header used to carry.

The caller passes an ordered list of RULE LABELS, not part paths, and members are
discovered by listing the rule's part dir. Deriving the member set a second time
in the Snakefile would mean re-deriving WF3's fan-out arithmetic (``ST_START``,
``RLZ_NUM``, the ``_batches`` split) somewhere it could drift from the rules that
actually own it. Scoping discovery to the label list is what keeps this from
being a blind glob: an orphan dir left by a renamed rule (``test_local`` still
holds ``2.03_monthly_change/``) is not a label, so it is never read and never
deleted.

A rule with no part is reported rather than silently skipped, so the merged log
says which sections its run actually covers. Absent is NORMAL, not a fault: a
rule already up to date does not re-run and writes no part, and a rule shared
between workflows (WF2's 2.11 is WF1's 1.10) usually logged over there.

    The merged log is the durable artifact; the parts are scratch. Only the paths

    exactly as found -- deleting what this run does not own is not this rule's
    call. Directory pruning only ever removes *empty* dirs, ``parts_dir`` itself
    included, which is what makes ``logs/_parts/`` disappear on a clean full run.

    Pruning ``parts_dir`` is safe here only because a caller's ``parts_dir``
    holds nothing another run owns. WF1 and WF2 do share
    ``<project_dir>/logs/_parts``, so each prunes a dir the other may be about to
    write -- harmless, because pruning removes only EMPTY dirs and each run
    recreates what it needs. WF3 is given its own
    ``<project_dir>/logs/_parts/<experiment>``, which is stronger: its part names
    are rule numbers, identical across experiments, so a shared dir would let one
    experiment's stranded part be merged into another's log and deleted with it.

    A leftover member part -- ``rlz_5_st_1`` after ``realizations_num`` drops to
    3 -- IS merged, since it sits in a live rule's dir. It is then deleted with
    the rest, so the condition shows in one log and heals itself; the same trade
    ``merge_benchmarks`` makes for a renamed rule's row (``dev/followups-archive.md``
