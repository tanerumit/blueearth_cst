"""The four evaluation sheets rule 1.15 draws for each modelled station.

One station, four figures, split by the question a reader is asking:

* ``hydrograph_<wflow_id>`` — what the model produces. Daily series, annual
  means, the mean annual cycle and both flow-duration curves. The ONLY sheet
  that needs no observations, so it is drawn for every station on every run.
* ``signatures_peaks_<wflow_id>`` — the high end. Flood frequency, the
  year-by-year annual maximum against observed, and the wettest year.
* ``signatures_lows_<wflow_id>`` — the dry end, in the same three places, so the
  two sheets read against each other without re-learning the layout.
* ``performance_<wflow_id>`` — goodness of fit: the daily scatter, the
  cumulative volume that shows WHEN a bias accrues, and the metrics table.

This replaces ``func_plot_signature.plot_hydro`` (five stacked panels) and
``plot_signatures`` (ten untitled ones). What changed beyond the layout:

* **Keyed by wflow_id.** The old figures were named ``wflow_1`` — a 1..N counter
  invented in ``plot_results`` — or by a station_name the delineation generated.
  Every other artifact of a run names a point by its ``wflow_id``: the
  ``Q_1010`` column in ``output.csv``, the registry, the labels on
  ``basin_area``. So do these.
* **Three unit errors fixed.** The annual and monthly panels plotted
  ``resample(...).sum()`` of a series in m3 s-1 and labelled the result
  ``m3 yr-1`` / ``m3 month-1`` — wrong by 86400, since a sum of daily mean
  discharges is not a volume. They are means now, in m3 s-1, which is also the
  unit of the daily panel above them. Cumulative discharge, labelled
  ``m3 s-1``, is a real volume here.
* **The performance panel can show failure.** Its predecessor pinned the y axis
  to [0, 1], so a model with NSE = -3 plotted off the bottom and looked
  identical to one scoring 0. It is a table now, and the table prints what the
  number is.
* **The log flow-duration curve is a log AXIS**, not ``np.log(Q)`` on a linear
  one. This basin has zero-flow days, and those became ``-inf``.

Nothing here reads or writes a file except the figures themselves;
``model/plot_results.py`` resolves the model, the registry and the observations.
