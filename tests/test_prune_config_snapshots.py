"""Unit tests for dev/scripts/prune_config_snapshots.py.

A one-shot migration for the config-snapshot redesign (2026-08-13): the
content-addressed bundles are no longer written by anything, and Snakemake
cannot clean a directory it no longer declares.

These pin the SCOPE, not the reporting. Deleting too little is a nuisance;
deleting one of the three protected classes destroys something no rule
regenerates, so each has its own test naming what would be lost.
