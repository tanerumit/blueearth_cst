"""Stage CMIP6 slices for one region, outside any project.

What it does
------------
The same thing WF2's rule 2.04 does — open the remote CMIP6 store, clip to a
polygon plus a buffer, slice the acquisition window, write a small netCDF — but
driven by a YAML file and writing wherever you point it, with no project and no
Snakemake run.

**The slices are WF2-cache-compatible.** Each file is stamped with the same
``cst_raw_digest`` the pipeline computes, so dropping one into a project's
``data/climate/projections/<clim_project>/raw/`` makes WF2 treat it as a cache
hit and skip the download. That is the point of the tool: WF2's raw cache is
project-scoped, so every new project on the same basin re-pays the remote open,
measured at **1142 s per source** (``fetch_gcm_raw`` docstring). Stage once
here, reuse everywhere.

For that to work the REGION must be the same polygon the project uses — the
digest covers it (``series_identity.region_fingerprint``). A different polygon
is a different slice by design, and its file will simply be re-fetched by the
project rather than silently accepted.

Why this is not a `stage_data.py` dataset type
----------------------------------------------
``stage_data.py`` mirrors a directory tree under one ``source_root`` by joining
``path``. CMIP6 is ``(model, scenario, member, variable)`` tuples resolved
through a GENERATED catalog with ``{member}`` / ``{variable}`` placeholders, on
an object store. The addressing has nothing in common, so this is a sibling
tool rather than a new ``type:``.

There is exactly ONE fetch implementation: ``fetch_gcm_raw.fetch_raw_slice``,
which WF2's rule 2.04 also calls. This module contributes the config and the
digest recipe, never a second way to read the store.

Configuration
-------------
All knobs live in a YAML file (default: ``dev/scripts/stage_cmip6.yml``)::

    region: C:/basins/gabon/region.geojson
    target_root: C:/data/cmip6_slices
    catalog: config/catalogs/cmip6_data.yml
    store_index: config/catalogs/cmip6_store_index.json
    clim_project: cmip6
    buffer_cells: 1
    models:    [NOAA-GFDL/GFDL-ESM4, INM/INM-CM4-8]
    scenarios: [historical, ssp245]
    members:   [r1i1p1f1]
    variables:                       # POST-rename names, not pr/tas
      precip: {units: kg m-2 s-1}
      temp:   {units: K}

The acquisition window is NOT a knob: it is derived per scenario by
``series_identity.acquisition_window``, exactly as the Snakefile derives it, so
a staged slice covers the window the pipeline expects.

Usage
-----
    python dev/scripts/stage_cmip6.py
    python dev/scripts/stage_cmip6.py --config my_basin.yml
    python dev/scripts/stage_cmip6.py --dry-run          # list jobs, fetch none
    python dev/scripts/stage_cmip6.py --models NOAA-GFDL/GFDL-ESM4
    python dev/scripts/stage_cmip6.py --workers 8        # 4 slices at once by default
    python dev/scripts/stage_cmip6.py --workers 1        # serial, for a real traceback

The requested cross product is PRE-FILTERED against the catalog, which already
records which (model, scenario) pairs exist and which members each carries. Much
of a naive cross product is not real: of 65 models with `historical`, 19 never
published `ssp245`, and 70 of 289 entries do not offer `r1i1p1f1`. Those are
refused before a worker starts, with the reason -- and for a missing member, the
members the entry DOES have. Nothing is auto-substituted: choosing a different
realisation is a methodological decision, not a convenience.

Slices are staged in parallel PROCESSES because the cost is the remote open, not
compute -- see `DEFAULT_WORKERS` for the measurement and for why threads are the
wrong tool here. Progress is reported in completion order, and one unavailable
source is reported without ending the run.

The closing report separates what the catalog refused, what could not be read
(a few models publish `Amon` on a non-rectilinear grid that hydromt's raster
accessor cannot take), and what simply failed -- because those call for
different actions.

Console output
--------------
The surface is `stage_data.py`'s, through the same vendored `console.py`:
Description / Parameters / Stage / Total regions, the `+ = - x` glyph
vocabulary coloured on the glyph, the 0/2/4/6 indent ladder, and one verdict
line. The two tools are read by the same person on the same afternoon, so a
reader should not have to relearn where the counts are. What is NOT borrowed is
the shape of what this tool has to say: the `[n/total]` completion counter (a
slice can take twenty minutes, so a silent console is a defect) and the
three-way failure split above, which `stage_data.py` has no equivalent for.

Headings are bold Title Case with NO decoration, and the only rule drawn is the
one above `Total` -- the hard break before the final aggregate. They read
`━━ SECTION ━━` in any copy predating `console.py` 0.10.0; check
`console.__version__` against the `console-formatting` skill before assuming
the older shape is current.

What the FETCH says is not this tool's console surface and is not reimplemented
here. Each slice runs inside WF2's own `tee_to_log`, so hydromt's records are
compacted, the mute table drops the rows that state a property of the run, and
what remains is written to `<target_root>/logs/<key>.log` as well as shown --
identically to what the same fetch prints under Snakemake. Two consequences
worth stating: a console fix belongs in `shared/snake_utils.py`, where both
paths get it, and a slice that failed has a full log part with its traceback in
it, which the closing report names.

Not part of a run: this is an authoring/staging helper
(see AGENTS.md, "Three homes for executables").

    matching names -- which is what it did until 2026-08-19.

    Returns rather than raises so one unavailable source cannot end a staging
    run that may have hours of other work in it -- a model missing a member is
    an ordinary catalog fact. The error is stringified HERE because an arbitrary
    exception may not survive the trip back to the parent process intact.

    The duration is measured INSIDE the worker, so it is the slice's own cost
    and excludes process startup and queue wait. That is the number worth
    reporting: it is dominated by the remote store OPEN (benchmarked at 19 s to
    transfer against a far larger open), so a slow slice means a slow store, not
    a slow machine or a saturated pool.

    The fetch runs inside ``tee_to_log`` -- WF2's own context manager, not a
    local imitation of it. That is what makes this tool a WRAPPER around the
    workflow's fetch rather than a second implementation of it: the compaction
    of hydromt's log format, the console mute table, path shortening, the
    severity colouring and the silence watchdog are all the pipeline's, so a
    row reads the same here as it does under Snakemake and only ONE of them has
    to be maintained. Without it, hydromt's ``StreamHandler`` writes straight
    past this process at its full ``<date> - <dotted.name> - <module> - INFO -``
    width, and every fetch row lands on the console beside the entry this tool
    prints for the same slice.

    ``tee_to_log`` re-raises, so the ``with`` sits INSIDE the ``try``: the
    traceback is written into the slice's log part on the way out and the
    return-not-raise contract above is unchanged.
