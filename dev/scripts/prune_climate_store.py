"""Report and optionally delete orphaned historical climate stores.

Sibling of ``prune_series_cache.py``, which covers the WF2 *series* class only.
That script's contract is keyed to the CMIP6 series filename grammar under
``data/climate/projections/<clim_project>/scalar/``; the historical store is a
different artifact class in a different tree with a different key, so it gets
its own script rather than a second mode in that one.

**Why orphans happen here.**
``data/climate/historical/<clim_source>_<start>_<end>/``
is a *cache key*, not multi-window support (R09 design Finding 3,
`dev/milestones/r09/migration_project-tree.md`): two experiments sharing a
source and a window reuse one extraction. The consequence is that changing
``shared.clim_historical`` or ``shared.historical_window`` mints a NEW key and
strands the predecessor — with nothing in the repository to report it. Snakemake
cannot clean a directory it no longer declares.

Orphaned stores cannot corrupt a product: every consumer declares the active
store path explicitly, resolved from the same config this script reads. This is
disk hygiene, and the stores are large (a gridded multi-decade extraction), so
it is worth doing — but it is an explicit owner action.

**Default is a dry run.** Nothing is deleted without ``--delete``, mirroring
``prune_series_cache.py``'s stated contract: a store may have cost a long
download to produce.

Usage (from the repo root, inside pixi)::

    python dev/scripts/prune_climate_store.py --config test_case/project_config_baseline.yml
    python dev/scripts/prune_climate_store.py --config <cfg> --delete

Not part of a run: this inspects and maintains a project tree
(see AGENTS.md, "Three homes for executables").
