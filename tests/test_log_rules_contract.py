"""``LOG_RULES`` must name exactly the rules that write a log part.

``merge_logs`` discovers a rule's parts by listing the directory named after its
``LOG_RULES`` label, and is deliberately scoped to that list so a renamed rule's
orphan directory is never read. The consequence is that **both** directions of
disagreement fail silently:

* a rule whose label is **missing** from the list writes parts that are neither
  merged nor cleaned up — its section vanishes from the merged log while the
  files accumulate on disk forever;
* a label with **no producing rule** contributes an empty "no part from this
  run" section to every merged log, forever.

Neither raises. Both have happened: rules 1.01b, 3.01b and 2.03b were each added
without their label, and ``2.11_extract_climate_grid`` outlived the rule ADR 0003
§5 deleted (`dev/followups-archive.md` [R10-8]). ``rule-naming-design.md`` treats this as
checklist discipline for the R10 sweep — the single edit most likely to break
exactly this surface. It is mechanically checkable, so it is checked here
instead.

The label is derived from each rule's own ``log:`` path rather than from its
name, which is what makes the batched Wflow rule fall out correctly: its
identifiers are ``run_wflow_batch_<b>`` (one per batch, parse-time generated)
while every batch writes into a single ``<W.NN>_run_wflow`` directory. Deriving
from the path records that divergence as the deliberate thing it is (P3-3).

**This module is the ONLY home for the property** (`dev/followups-archive.md`
``[R10-10]``). ``tests/test_model_reference.py`` used to assert a subset of it
by slicing the ``LOG_RULES`` text to the first ``]`` and matching an f-string
label form; both were wrong in ways that let a real failure sit unread, and two
modules asserting one property by different parsers is how they came to
disagree. Do not re-add a second parser — extend this one.
