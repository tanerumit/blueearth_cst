"""Cache identity for the persistent GCM series store (WF2 v2.0, design §5.3).

The series files under ``data/climate/projections/{clim_project}/`` stop being
``temp()`` at migration step 2b and become a persistent product. Persistence
without identity is a silent-wrong-numbers path: a file on disk looks valid
whatever produced it. This module is the identity — it answers "was this series
derived from exactly the inputs the current configuration implies?" and it is
used from three places:

* the **Snakefile**, at DAG-build time, to put every parse-time-knowable digest
  component into the rule's ``params`` so Snakemake's params rerun-trigger
  schedules re-derivation when any of them changes;
* the **reduce job** (``get_stats_climate_proj.py``), which completes the digest
  with the polygon fingerprint, revalidates against any existing output, and
  stamps the result on what it writes;
* the **change job** (``get_change_climate_proj.py``), which recomputes every
  expected digest and raises on mismatch — the backstop that holds even when
  Snakemake's scheduling did not run (design D9, route (b)).

Why the polygon is fingerprinted by **content** and not by the region
specification (design D9 / finding ext2-01): a delineation-catalog change can
rewrite ``spatial/geoms/region.geojson`` while ``shared.basin.region`` is
unchanged, so a
specification-based digest recomputes to the same value and a series computed for
the old polygon stays eligible for reuse.

Why the reducer version is a **module hash** and not a hand-bumped constant
(finding risk-03): Snakemake's code rerun-trigger tracks a rule's script body,
not the modules it imports, so a forgotten bump silently reuses every cached
series after a reduction-logic change.

Everything here is stdlib plus the geopandas stack already in the environment —
no new dependency (design OQ-7 / constraint C5).

#: Bumped when the series schema changes in a way a reader must notice — the
#: attribute set, the digest recipe, or the key grammar. A consumer that meets a
#: version it does not know must FAIL rather than guess (design §5.3).
#:
#: ``"2"`` (revision 6, the fetch/reduce split): the attribute set changed in both
#: layers — a series gains ``cst_raw_digest`` naming the slice it was reduced from,
#: and raw slices are a new artifact class carrying ``cst_raw_digest`` and no
#: ``cst_series_digest``. Bumping is what makes the existing v1 series re-derive
#: instead of being silently accepted without the new provenance; it is nearly free
#: now that a re-reduction reads local disk.
SCHEMA_VERSION = "6"
#: Bumped 5->6 when the NEWEST published version started winning in
#: `pinned_uri` (owner ruling 2026-08-19; the before/after counts are in
#: dev/reference/workflows/wf2-cmip6-store-readability.md, section 2). Unlike every
#: bump below it, no attribute and no digest component changed -- what changed is
#: the RULE applied to a component. The digest carries the pins, never the
#: resolution of them, so a slice built by merging two published versions and a
#: slice read from the newest one are indistinguishable by digest. Most affected
#: sources never staged at all (the merge raised), but the ones where it
#: SUCCEEDED -- two versions differing only in metadata -- would go on serving a
#: cache hit for bytes this code no longer produces. The bump is the only thing
#: that can tell those apart, and it costs one re-fetch.
#: Bumped 4->5 for the `buffer_degrees` -> `buffer_cells` rename (t2608182238):
#: the digest component key and the `cst_buffer_*` attribute both change name, so
#: the attribute set changed and a reader must notice. The rename moves the digest
#: on its own -- key names are canonicalized into the hash -- but that alone would
#: re-derive SILENTLY, which is the mixed-provenance failure ruled against in
#: t2608182020. The bump is what makes an existing slice refuse loudly instead.
#: The buffer's VALUE and the footprint it selects are unchanged: hydromt always
#: spent it as a cell count, and only the name said otherwise.
#: Bumped 3->4 at step 5b: the SERIES schema gained `cst_calendar`, propagated
#: from the raw slice so stage B can weight months without re-reading the store.
#: The bump is required, not tidiness: the stamping lives in the snakemake body,
#: OUTSIDE the functions `kernel_hash` enumerates, so `REDUCER_HASH` does not move
#: and every reduce job would hit its internal cache and skip -- Snakemake
#: schedules the job, the job revalidates and returns, and the new attribute is
#: never written. Observed exactly that before this bump: series rewritten at
#: 21:19 with schema 3 and no `cst_calendar`.
#: Side effect stated plainly: raw slices carry the version too, so they re-fetch
#: as well even though they are already correct. Accepted over splitting the raw
#: and series schemas, which would be a contract change to save one dev re-fetch.
#: Bumped 2->3 at step 5b's prerequisite: raw slices and series written before
#: this carry `cst_calendar = ""` while their `time.attrs` assert
#: `proleptic_gregorian`, which is FALSE for every noleap/360_day model
#: (dev/milestones/r08/2026-07-30_wf2-5b-calendar-blocker.md). The calendar cannot join
#: the digest components -- reading it needs the store, and DAG build is
#: deliberately network-free -- so the version bump is the invalidation lever, and
#: `cache_hit` already rejects on a schema mismatch. Costs one re-derivation.

#: Acquisition span per experiment class, lifted out of
#: ``get_stats_climate_proj.py``'s ``time_tuple_all`` branch into a declared
#: contract (design §5.3). Deliberately independent of ``future_horizons``: all
#: analysis-window selection happens downstream on local files, so changing a
#: horizon schedules zero reduce jobs (goal G5).

    This is the cache key risk-03 actually wants. ``module_hash`` tracks file

    an error-handling-only edit invalidated all 9 series and cost a full network
    re-derivation. Bytecode plus constants tracks behaviour: comments, docstrings
    and formatting never appear in ``co_code`` or in the hashed constants, while
    any change to the computation does.

    What it catches: a changed formula, a changed constant of **any type**
    including strings (``co_consts``), a swapped attribute or global lookup
    (``co_names``), a changed default argument (``__defaults__`` /
    ``__kwdefaults__``), a different call sequence, and — when

    between ``ds["pr"]`` and ``ds["tas"]``, between ``keep="first"`` and
    ``"last"``, or between two date bounds is *only* a string constant: ``co_code``

    (design amendment pending) makes that re-reduction local and cheap.

    What it still deliberately misses: a change in a *callee* that is not itself
    listed — so the enumeration must name every function whose arithmetic matters,

    ``env_fingerprint`` folds the environment into the same digest: the reduction's

      removes is **hydromt's resolver overhead on a wildcard URI**, not bucket
      latency. Do not describe it as avoiding a slow network listing.

    The second, non-timing reason to keep this: the job addresses one known store
    instead of resolving a pattern whose match set can change under it.

    **The NEWEST version wins (owner ruling, 2026-08-19).** Until then this
    returned ``None`` — "keep the glob" — whenever a variable recorded more than
    one published version, on the reasoning that the ambiguity should stay
    visible rather than be resolved silently. What that produced was not
    visibility: the glob opened every version at once, and the read died inside
    xarray's combine with `MergeError: conflicting values for variable 'pr'`, or
    `OutOfBoundsDatetime` when the versions covered different spans. Those
    sources simply never staged; section 2 of
    ``dev/reference/workflows/wf2-cmip6-store-readability.md`` carries the
    measurement. A rule nobody can act on is not a safeguard.

    Measured over the 289-entry index (2426 member combinations): 2205 already
    pin one version and are untouched; **182 are resolved by taking the newest
    per variable**; 39 still refuse, because ``pr``'s newest and ``tas``'s newest
    are different locations and one URI cannot express both — the ``{variable}``
    placeholder is expanded inside a single path.

    Refuses when the pins name more than one **grid label**, which no member in
    today's index does. Choosing between ``gn`` and ``gr`` is choosing a
    regridding, not a revision, and a plain ``max()`` would make that choice
    silently the moment such a member appeared.

    Refuses when any variable pins nothing, as before: an empty match list is not
    a location.

    This does **not** change the series digest, and must not: the digest is built at
    DAG build from the *catalog* entry, whose URI is the logical template, while the
    pin it also records is the physical identity (D12's own framing). Rewriting the
    URI inside the job spends the pin the digest already carries; it adds no
    component and re-derives nothing.

    Which is exactly why ``SCHEMA_VERSION`` moved to ``"6"`` with this change.
    The digest carries the pins, not the rule applied to them, so a slice built
    by merging two versions and a slice read from the newest one are
    indistinguishable by digest — and the sources where the old merge SUCCEEDED
    (two versions differing only in metadata) would otherwise keep serving a
    cache hit for bytes this code would no longer produce. The bump costs one

    Split out because these are all knowable at DAG-build time and belong in the

    polygon fingerprint deliberately is not here: on a fresh project the polygon
    does not exist at parse time, and a param flipping from absent to a real
    value on the second invocation would re-derive every series once for nothing
    (design §6.14). It is folded in inside the job by :func:`series_digest`.

    **``members`` is a sequence, not a single member.** At migration step 2b the
    ``members:`` config key is still a list looped *inside* one job, so a single
    output covers every member in that list and the identity must span all of
    them. Step 3 turns the member into a wildcard, at which point the sequence
    has one element and this shape still holds — so the digest recipe does not
    change under that refactor.

    ``buffer_cells`` is a COUNT OF GRID CELLS, not degrees. hydromt spends the
    ``buffer`` argument as resolution multiplicity (``data_catalog.py:1370`` ->
    ``clip_bbox``), so the same value buys 0.70 deg on EC-Earth3 and 2.77 deg on
    CanESM5. It was named ``buffer_degrees`` until t2608182238; the value and the
    footprint never changed, only the name that lied about them.

    Note the region **bounds** are deliberately absent: they are derived from the
    polygon, so they add nothing the content fingerprint does not already carry,
    and they are unavailable at parse time. Bounds are still *recorded* on the
