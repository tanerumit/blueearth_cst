"""A1 acceptance test for the OQ-4 30-year reference window (step 5f).

The design's §8 gate for 5f: "effective values asserted (`n_hyd_years`, effective
bounds, per-end dropped months) for January and non-January
`start_month_hyd_year`, plus the no-clip/no-short-window check".

This test exists because A1's claim is *arithmetic about a specific window*, and
that arithmetic was wrong until 2026-07-30 — the January case returned 29 where
A1 says 30 (`dev/milestones/r08/2026-07-30_wf2-5f-hydyear-offbyone.md`). Written after
the fix, deliberately, so it asserts the ruling rather than the behaviour.
