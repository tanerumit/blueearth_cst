"""Month-length weights in the model's own calendar (design §5.6, step 5b).

The annual aggregate treated all twelve months alike: `.sum()` for precip,
`.mean()` for temp. That makes a 28-day February count as much as a 31-day
January, and — worse for the design's actual purpose — it makes annual means
differ between a `360_day` model and a `noleap` one **for procedural reasons**,
not physical ones. This module supplies the weights that remove that.

**Why the lengths are derived from `(calendar, year, month)` and never from the
time axis.** The series' axis is `datetime64`: our catalog requests
`preprocess: harmonise_dims`, whose time branch converts a `CFTimeIndex` away
(`hydromt/data_catalog/drivers/preprocessing.py:66`). `time.dt.days_in_month` on
that axis returns **Gregorian** lengths — 29 for February in a leap year — for a
model that has no such day. The calendar name is carried separately on the series
(`cst_calendar`, put there by the fetch reading the store; see
`dev/records/milestones/r08/2026-07-30_wf2-5b-calendar-blocker.md`), and the converted axis still
carries year and month exactly, which is all that is needed alongside it.
