"""How the WF2 projection figures are DRAWN.

Split from :mod:`blueearth_cst.projections.projection_figures`, which declares
WHAT the family contains. The split is not tidiness: the Snakefile imports the
contract at parse time to build its target map, and ``snake_utils`` deliberately
keeps matplotlib out of that path (0.14 s to import, no pyplot). Putting the
drawing in the same module would drag matplotlib into every WF2 parse, including
the four dry-runs ``tests/test_cli.py`` performs. Contract: pure. Drawing: here.

Both WF2 producers import from this module — ``get_change_climate_proj_summary``
for the two cloud views off the stage-B merge, ``plot_proj_timeseries`` for the
annual overviews and the monthly figures — which is why the palette and the page
furniture live here rather than in either of them.

The page contract, reused rather than re-derived
------------------------------------------------
Everything draws under ``_publication_rc()`` at ``series_figure_size(...)``, in
CONSTRAINED layout, with the caveat carried by ``fig.supxlabel(..., wrap=True)``
— the same four decisions ``climate_analysis/climate_figures.py`` makes for the
WF1 series figures, imported from the same place it imports them from.

* ``layout="constrained"`` rather than ``tight_layout``, because the WF1 maps
  are built on it and a figure family that mixes the two cannot be made to agree
  on its margins.
* ``supxlabel`` rather than a hand-placed ``fig.text``, because it is part of the
  layout, so a long caveat re-flows instead of being drawn off the canvas.
  ``fig.text`` does not clip — it silently loses the tail, which is how the
  first draft of this design dropped "CMIP6 is a plausibility overlay, not a
  stress-test driver" off the right-hand edge of every figure.
