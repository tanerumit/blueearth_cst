    """The edge alone is not the guard — this is what P4 missed.

    Rule 3.09 declaring the sentinel as an input orders the guard BEFORE the
    work, and the test above pins that. But a sentinel that survives the run
    satisfies that edge with a STALE VERDICT: the check passed once against
    model M1, the file remains, and a later invocation re-simulates against M2
    without the guard running at all.

    Demonstrated in isolation at the R9 landing gate, on a two-rule probe, so
    the result does not depend on WF3's scheduling quirks:

      * consumer up to date, model drifted -> nothing runs. Safe by INACTION:
        the guard does not fire, but neither does the consumer.
      * consumer must re-run, model drifted -> with a persisted sentinel the
        guard is NOT scheduled and the consumer runs anyway; with temp() the
        guard IS scheduled, first, and stops it.

    The second case is the hole. It needs 3.09 to genuinely re-run — a different
    `-c` (the batch split is core-derived), deleted temp intermediates, a retried
    failure, added realizations — so it is narrower than "every re-run", and
    saying otherwise would overstate it.

    Confirmed end to end in the real workflow: model perturbed, 3.09 forced to
    re-run at the tree's own core count, the run stopped at 1 of 34 steps with
    ModelDriftError and no member simulated. Detection was correct throughout;
    only the trigger was missing.

    `temp()` is the trigger: Snakemake deletes the sentinel once 3.09 has
    consumed it, so the next invocation finds it absent and re-evaluates against
    whatever the pointer-derived digest currently covers. That is also why the
    fix is not "drop ancient() from model_toml" — the digest reaches files this
    rule does not declare, and declaring them would duplicate what
    `model_digest` discovers through the TOML's pointers.
