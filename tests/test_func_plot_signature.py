"""Unit tests for ``blueearth_cst/shared/func_plot_signature.py``.

The module had NO direct coverage until 2026-08-11
(`dev/reviews/2026-08-11_test-suite-bloat-assessment.md` §4), while being a
shared helper with three consumers — ``model/plot_results.py``,
``shared/plot_evaluation.py`` and ``shared/wflow_outputs.py``. That is the
profile AGENTS.md names as *"a contract surface with other callers"*: only its
rule wiring was pinned, never its arithmetic.

Two halves, and they are tested differently.

* ``compute_metrics`` writes ``performance_metrics.csv``, which the performance
  sheet RENDERS rather than recomputes — so the numbers here reach a deliverable
  unchecked by anything downstream. Tested as arithmetic: the perfect-fit
  identities, the sign convention of ``Pbias``, and the daily/monthly split
  actually discriminating (the whole reason the table has two rows per metric).
* ``plot_basavg`` is a figure, and a figure is verified by rendering it and
  looking at it (AGENTS.md, "Figures are terminal artifacts"). What is tested
  here is therefore STRUCTURE, not appearance — how many panels exist, in what
  order, under which resample rule. Every case below stands for the 2026-08-10
  defect recorded in the function's own docstring: the per-subcatchment series
  were drawn as one object, which was correct only by accident while a basin had
  exactly one subcatchment, and dispatched to ``pcolormesh`` at four.
