"""Update a wflow model with reservoirs, lakes and glaciers.

This runs as a **separate rule** from the build (1.07 ``build_wflow_model``)
for two reasons, and neither is an upstream limitation.

Per-method no-data: a basin may legitimately lack reservoirs, lakes or
glaciers, so each method runs individually here and a ``NoDataException`` skips
only that one. This much COULD move into the build — ``build_wflow_model``
applies its own steps through the same kind of loop
(``_apply_parameter_steps``), so the tolerance is ours to add, not hydromt's to
fix.

Failure isolation is why it does not move. Rule 1.07 resamples soil, land-use
and LAI grids and scales with basin size, so on a production basin it is one of
the expensive rules; the waterbody methods depend on external catalog sources
that are often absent or mis-resolved. Folding them in would redo the whole
parameterization whenever a catalog lookup fails — trading a fixed few seconds
for a rebuild cost that grows with the basin.

The earlier note here claimed the split existed because hydromt 1.3's
``hydromt build`` cannot tolerate per-method no-data, with a removal trigger
waiting on upstream. That trigger is withdrawn: rule 1.07 never invokes the
``hydromt build`` CLI, so the condition could not have fired. Measurements and
the full argument are in ``dev/tasks/t2609041718``.
