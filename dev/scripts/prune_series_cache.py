"""Report and optionally delete orphaned WF2 series files.

The series store became persistent at migration step 2b, and correctness
deliberately does not depend on the directory's contents: stage B reads an
explicit expanded list built from resolution and asserts each file's digest, so a
stale or orphaned series **cannot** enter a product (design §5.3, risk **R4**).
Pruning is therefore disk hygiene, and the design names it "an explicit user
action; a pruning helper is a follow-up, not a correctness fix". This is that
follow-up.

Two things make orphans routine rather than exceptional:

* **Key-grammar changes.** Steps 2b, 3 and 4b each changed the series filename
  (``historical_stats_time_{model}`` → ``series/{key}`` → ``series/{key}_{member}``
  → ``scalar/{key}``),
  leaving the previous generation behind each time.
* **Config changes.** Dropping a model or a scenario from the config removes it
  from resolution, so its series stops being referenced but stays on disk.

**Default is a dry run.** Nothing is deleted without ``--delete``, because the
whole point of the persistent cache is that a series may have cost hours to
produce while being a few KB to keep.

Usage (from the repo root, inside pixi)::

    python dev/scripts/prune_series_cache.py --config test_case/snake_config_baseline.yml
    python dev/scripts/prune_series_cache.py --config <cfg> --delete

Not part of a run: this inspects and maintains a project tree
(see AGENTS.md, "Three homes for executables").
