"""ADR 0003 §8: one vector foundation, one producer contract, three declarations.

The vector layers used to be by-products of rule 1.02, whose real product is
``spatial_maps.nc`` and the thematic raster stack behind it. WF2 and WF3 could
therefore only reach basin and subbasin boundaries by declaring a rule that
resamples ``vito``, ``modis_lai`` and ``soilgrids`` — the trade ADR 0003 exists
to have removed, one level down.

These pin the replacement: ``snake_utils.spatial_units_rule`` owns the contract,
and the three workflow declarations of ``delineate_spatial_units`` may differ
only in ``message`` / ``log`` / ``benchmark``. Same shape, and the same reason,
as ``tests/test_region_rule.py`` and ``tests/test_climate_store_contract.py`` —
the third and last member of that family.
