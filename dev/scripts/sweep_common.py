"""Shared machinery for the repository sweeps.

A sweep here is a report-only check that reads the tree, classifies every hit,
and **fails closed**: a hit that matches no declared class is a defect, and a
sweep that cannot see its own subject matter refuses to report rather than
reporting nothing (D-14.4, D-14.5).

Extracted from `sweep_stale_spellings.py` when the second sweep arrived, so the
two cannot drift on what an allowance is, which directories are out of scope, or
what a clean run means. `C-37` is the third caller and this file is its contract
too — add here only what more than one sweep needs.

The three pieces:

* `Allowance` — one class of legitimate hit, WITH the reason it is legitimate.
  A sweep that just suppressed hits would be an allowlist nobody can review.
* `iter_lines` — the walk, with the excluded directories in one place.
* `Floor` / `check_floors` — the fail-closed half. A sweep derives some GROUND
  TRUTH before it looks for defects (the retired-key vocabulary; the record
  forms it can recognise). If that derivation silently returns less than it
  used to, the sweep goes quiet while knowing LESS, and nothing in its output
  says so. R14 demonstrated exactly that: an extraction returned zero and the
  run reported MORE flags than the pass before it.
