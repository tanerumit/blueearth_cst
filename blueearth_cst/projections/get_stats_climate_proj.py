# gcsfs >= 2026.4 enables an experimental Extended filesystem by default that

# geopandas, hydromt and xarray are DEFERRED, and to two DIFFERENT places,
# because the module's heavy uses are split between them:
#
#   * `get_stats_clim_projections` uses `xr.merge`, and nothing else heavy, so
#     xarray alone is imported at the top of that function;
#   * the `__main__` entry point uses `gpd.read_file`, `xr.open_dataset`, a
#     second `xr.merge` and `.raster.vars`, so geopandas, xarray AND hydromt are
#     imported there -- INSIDE the `tee_to_log` block, never above it.
#     `tee_to_log` repoints library handlers bound before entry, so an import
#     landing after entry has to keep landing after entry or hydromt's
#     StreamHandler binds to the real stdout and bypasses the log file. Same
#     reasoning, same placement, as `fetch_gcm_raw.py`.
#
# xarray is therefore imported in BOTH scopes, which is correct rather than
# redundant: `sys.modules` makes the second one free, and neither scope may
# depend on the other having run.
#
# `analyze_projections.smk` imports this module at PARSE time so
# `REDUCER_KERNEL` can hold the FUNCTION OBJECT -- the enumeration is what stops
# a changed weighting from being silently reused across the series cache -- and
# the object is required, but the heavy stack is not. hydromt alone costs ~16s
# of a WF2 dry-run, entirely for the `.raster` accessor registration one line
# uses.
#
# Each deferral sits at the TOP of its scope rather than beside the first use:
# hydromt is imported for its SIDE EFFECT (it registers xarray's `.raster`
# accessor), so what has to be guaranteed is that it runs before any `.raster`
# access, not merely somewhere inside the call.
