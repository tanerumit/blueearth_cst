"""Contract tests for `dev/scripts/stage_cmip6.py`.

The tool's whole claim is that its slices are WF2-cache-compatible — drop one
into a project's ``raw/`` and the pipeline accepts it instead of re-opening the
remote store. That claim rests entirely on the tool rebuilding the same digest
the Snakefile builds, from a recipe that lives in two places
(``analyze_projections.smk::series_digest_components`` and
``stage_cmip6.digest_components``) and therefore can drift.

Two layers, deliberately:

* NAMING and RECIPE-SHAPE cases run on every checkout, including a bare CI leg.
  They pin the filename grammar and that the raw components carry no reducer
  hash — the exclusion the whole stage-A split exists for.
* One FIXTURE case is the real guard: it recomputes the digest for a slice WF2
  itself wrote and asserts equality with the ``cst_raw_digest`` on the file. A
  drift in either recipe turns it red. It skips without ``test_case/``, and
  AGENTS.md records that a worktree lacking that tree downgrades rather than
  fails — so a green run here is not evidence this case ran.

    This is what makes the cache-compatibility claim checkable rather than
    asserted. It reads `cst_raw_digest` off files produced by a real WF2 run
    and rebuilds it from the tool's own recipe; the two must agree exactly, or
    a staged slice would be re-fetched instead of reused.

    Slices recorded under an OLDER `cst_schema_version` are passed over, not
    failed. A digest is only comparable within one schema: the pipeline itself
    rejects such a slice on the schema check (`cache_hit`) and re-fetches it
    before any digest is consulted, so an inequality here would say nothing
    about the tool's recipe. Skipping keeps a deliberate bump — 4->5 renamed the
    `buffer_degrees` component to `buffer_cells` (t2608182238) — from reading as
    a defect in this tool until the fixture is re-run. The whole-fixture skip
    below is what stops that concession from hiding a real break: once a run
    refreshes the tree, every slice is current and every slice is checked again.

    Slices whose `cst_entry_identity_digest` no longer matches the live catalog
    are passed over on the same reasoning, and this second case is why that
    attribute exists. A schema bump is not the only way to strand a fixture: a
    catalog edit moves `entry_identity`, and therefore every raw digest, while
    `cst_schema_version` sits still — so the skip above cannot see it and the
    suite goes red until someone re-runs WF2. That is a stale artifact, not a
    broken recipe, and t2608201134 records the occurrence that proved it
    (`b0963e9` added tasmin/tasmax to `cmip6_data.yml` 72 minutes after this
    fixture was written). What still FAILS is a mismatch the recorded
    provenance cannot account for: same schema, same catalog entry, different
    digest. That is the recipe breaking, which is what this test is for.
