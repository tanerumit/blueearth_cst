"""The shared cross-workflow leaf set is COMPLETE and MINIMAL (R9 P5 F3).

`dev/scripts/cross_workflow_inputs.LEAVES` replaced three hand-kept copies of
the same staging logic. That alone does not stop it going stale — it makes it go
stale in one place instead of three. This module is what stops it, by checking
the list against the real DAG rather than against another list:

* **complete** — staging exactly `LEAVES` lets both downstream workflows build
  their DAG. A rule that starts declaring a new cross-workflow input turns this
  red on the next run. That is precisely the escape R9 P4 shipped: rule 3.01c
  `write_model_reference` added two model leaves, one of the three stagers was
  not updated, and the failure surfaced later as a red assertion that read like
  a defect in the guard it was testing.
* **minimal** — dropping any single leaf breaks WF3's DAG, and the error names
  the file that was dropped. This is what keeps vestigial entries out. Both test
  fixtures still stage a region that nothing has read since ADR 0003; had it
  been folded into `LEAVES` rather than passed as an explicit extra, this test
  would fail and say so.

Deliberately NOT parametrized over a second list of expected paths: a test that
compared `LEAVES` to a copy of `LEAVES` would pass forever and prove nothing.
Snakemake is the authority here, which is why every assertion below runs it.
