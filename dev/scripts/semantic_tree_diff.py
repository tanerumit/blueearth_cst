"""Milestone full-tree semantic diff for the R06 structural refactor (design §9).

Walks a `project_dir` output tree and compares every file against a reference
tree, dispatching by extension to per-type comparators. This is the *un-manifested
slice* gate: it covers wf2/wf3 staticmaps, `wflow_sbm.toml`, and change-factor
NetCDFs that `check_baseline.py`'s thin `TARGETS` list never fingerprints.

Design contract (dev/milestones/r06/structural-refactor-design.md §9, rows ext1-04 / ext2-01
/ ext2-02):

- `.nc`  : ELEMENT-WISE comparator (dims; coordinate labels+order with NO
           realignment; exact NaN masks; per-element `_within_tol`; non-volatile
           attrs) -- NOT the aggregate `fingerprint_nc`/`diff_nc` stats.
- `.toml`: parse-and-normalize compare (structural, key-order/comment-insensitive).
- `.yml`/`.yaml` under `{project_dir}/config/` : the copied-config
           NORMALIZE-THEN-COMPARE policy (ext2-01) -- parse both sides, apply only
           the documented old->new path map to the reference, require everything
           else deep-equal.
- `.csv`, `.png`, discharge `output.csv` : REUSED verbatim from `check_baseline.py`
           (imported, never modified).

`check_baseline.py` is imported for its comparators; its own P3-1 edits (the
TARGETS repoint, G1 scope amendment) live in that file, not here. The
CSV/PNG/discharge comparators and `VOLATILE_NC_ATTRS` come from it by import.

P3-1 layer (dev/milestones/p31/experiment-structure-design.md §6a, commit 5):

- **Path map** -- an ORDERED list of directory-prefix rewrite rules on
  project-root-relative paths (NOT a per-file table; the prefix form also covers
  in-toml pointer targets that are `temp()`-deleted and exist in neither tree).
  Ref (old-layout) relpaths are translated old->new before pairing with the
  current tree, so a pure move is content-diffed instead of degrading to a
  MISSING+EXTRA pair.
- **Allowlist gate contract (risk-4)** -- after translation and content-diffing
  of translated pairs, the residual MISSING and EXTRA sets must be EMPTY modulo
  an explicitly enumerated allowlist (each entry justified in
  dev/milestones/p31/migration_experiment-structure.md). A nonempty unexplained
  MISSING/EXTRA is a gate FAILURE, not a pass.
- **Path-aware toml comparator (§6a step 3, ext1-3)** -- for each path-valued
  toml field: (1) lexical resolve against its own toml's dir (normpath+join,
  never `.resolve()`); (2) translate to project-root-relative by stripping that
  side's root; (3) apply the prefix map to the REF side's target; (4) compare --
  equal => the pointer move is behavior-neutral (PASS), different => a real
  failure naming the field (a mis-repoint is caught, not hidden).

CLI (self-contained; no snakemake global)::

    python dev/scripts/semantic_tree_diff.py --ref <dir> --cur <dir> [--tolerance 1e-9]
        [--experiment-name experiment] [--dataset-key era5_20000101_20201231]
        [--no-path-map] [--allow <relpath> ...]

Exit 0 = clean (every file equal under its comparator, residual MISSING/EXTRA
empty modulo the allowlist), 1 = at least one FAIL or unexplained
missing/extra file. A clean self-comparison (`--ref X --cur X`) is the smoke.

Path-map falsifier mode -- no trees, one path list::

    python dev/scripts/semantic_tree_diff.py --check-map <pathlist> \
        --experiment-name experiment --dataset-key era5_20000101_20201231

Classifies every project-relative path as MOVED / IDENTITY / DELETED /
UNMAPPED and exits 1 if anything is UNMAPPED. This is what makes the claim
"the map covers every artifact" testable: `apply_path_map` alone cannot
distinguish an identity rule from a fall-through, so `apply_path_map_matched`
reports whether a rule actually fired.

For a CURRENT tree this is not the entry point -- use
`dev/scripts/snapshot_project_tree.py`, which drives `build_project_tree_rules`
(the post-migration inventory) and is what `pixi run tree-check` runs.

**The R07 and R09 one-way migration maps were retired on 2026-08-11**
(`dev/reviews/2026-08-11_test-suite-bloat-assessment.md` §6a). They resolved
PRE-migration paths only, both milestones are sealed, and no pre-migration tree
survives to apply them to. Recover either verbatim from its tag -- `r07-layout`,
`r09-project-tree` -- if an archived tree ever needs re-verification. `p31`
stays as the `--milestone` default so a bare invocation, the form AGENTS.md's
validation ladder prescribes, behaves as it always has.

    **Why this exists, and why it was not the R9 migration map.** That map ran
    ONE WAY: pre-R9 paths to post-R9 ones. A live tree holds only the post-R9
    side, so nothing matched the old-side patterns and every relocated artifact
    fell through as UNMAPPED — `pixi run tree-check` returned exit 1 on every
    CORRECTLY migrated tree (`dev/followups-archive.md` `[R10-11]`; measured 153
    of 186 unmapped on a clean run, and 165 of 203 on a tree that predated the
    artifact people first suspected). The map was never wrong; it was being
    asked about an era that has passed.

    That era has now passed far enough that the map itself is gone — retired
    2026-08-11 with its R07 predecessor, recoverable from tag `r09-project-tree`
    (`dev/reviews/2026-08-11_test-suite-bloat-assessment.md` §6a). What remains
    is the question that outlives any migration: **does this tree hold anything
    nobody declared?** That is the property that caught `region.geojson` (R9
    phase-1 F1a) and that the ADR 0003 §8a seam intermediate needed a row for.

    Every rule maps a path to ITSELF, so a covered path classifies as IDENTITY
    and an unknown one still classifies as UNMAPPED. That distinction only
    exists through `apply_path_map_matched`, which is why identity is enumerated
    rather than written as a `data/` → `data/` catch-all: a catch-all would make
    the report empty by construction and the gate would pass unconditionally
    (`test_a_catch_all_config_prefix_would_empty_the_report` demonstrated the
    hazard on the R9 map, and `test_a_broad_data_prefix_would_empty_the_report`
    keeps demonstrating it here).

    DIRECTORY PREFIXES are used only where the contents are genuinely open —
    `plots/`, `staticgeoms/`, a wflow run directory, the projection tiers. Where
    the set of files is fixed, they are enumerated, so a new file in a settled
    directory is reported rather than absorbed.

    a byte hash reports a difference where the geometry is provably the same.

    passed before because the reference tree and the current tree were the
    same never-regenerated files.

    Compares CRS, row count, non-geometry columns and their values, and then
    geometry via shapely's `equals` (topological, order-insensitive) with a
    symmetric-difference-area fallback so a shape difference is reported with
