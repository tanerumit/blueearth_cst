"""Interchange-contract validators for the two CST substitution seams.

This module pins — as machine-checkable, pure functions — the contract
surfaces at the two points where a CST component could be swapped for an
alternative implementation:

- the **weather-generator seam** (``weathergenr`` today): validators
  ``validate_wg1``..``validate_wg6`` + the relational
  ``validate_wg5_catalog_grid``;
- the **hydrological-model seam** (Wflow-SBM built by hydromt today):
  validators ``validate_hm1``..``validate_hm7`` (no ``validate_hm6a`` — its
  contract surface is pinned transitively by HM-4) + the relational
  ``validate_hm_gauge_column_identity``.

Source of record: ``dev/milestones/p32b/interchange-contracts-design.md`` (ACCEPTED
2026-07-24, §5.5) and the two seam docs ``dev/reference/contracts/*-seam.md``.

Design invariants this module obeys (do not relax without a design change):

1. **Pure functions over PARSED objects.** Every validator takes an already
   parsed object — ``xarray.Dataset`` / ``pandas.DataFrame`` /
   ``dict``-from-yaml / ``dict``-from-``tomllib`` / ``geopandas.GeoDataFrame``
   — never a path. The caller owns all file I/O. This is what lets the same
   function serve a synthetic in-memory unit test, a real-fixture integration
   test, and a future in-pipeline guard with no move (design C5).
2. **``-> list[str]`` divergence report; empty list ⇒ pass.** Mirrors the
   house drift-guard ``compare_project_consistency``
   (``blueearth_cst/experiment/check_project_consistency.py``), not the
   ``ValueError``-raising ``validate_experiment_name``. Every violation is
   surfaced at once (better for a swapper diagnosing a candidate artifact).
3. **No ``assert`` / ``AssertionError`` in validator bodies.** ``assert`` is
   stripped under ``python -O`` / ``PYTHONOPTIMIZE``, so a future optimized
   in-pipeline guard lifting these functions would silently no-op — it would
   fail *open* on exactly the path this module is built for (design §6.5).
   A returned report never vanishes.
4. **Asserted-if-present semantics** where the design records a property but
   does not pin it as a hard contract surface — chiefly the HM-2 forcing
   units (wflow is name-keyed via the TOML ``[input.forcing]`` block, so no
   consumer reads the unit attr): the validator appends a message only when
   the attr is *present and wrong*; an absent attr never blocks (design §5.5).
5. **CST automation scope (C3).** Validators pin OUR consumed/rewritten
   subset of the upstream hydromt / wflow / weathergenr formats; they never
   assert an upstream-owned internal (the full staticmaps schema, wflow
   physics blocks, the outlets-map id derivation). See the per-validator
   docstrings for the pinned-vs-unpinned boundary.

Stdlib + xarray + pandas + geopandas + pyyaml + tomllib only — no new
dependency. This module is imported by ``tests/test_interchange_contracts.py``
and by **no** Snakefile rule: it is DAG-invisible and changes no pipeline
behavior (design C2).

    table. The mechanism changes with it, not only the constants: a 12-row
    assertion becomes ``12 x ST_NUM`` plus a ``(st_id, month)`` completeness
    check, and ``st_0`` must be ABSENT.

    ``st_num`` reaches this validator as an argument, the way the relational

    inferred from the table itself and only its internal consistency is checked

    could not tell a complete table from a truncated one.

    Three things are checked that the old per-member shape could not express:

    - **``st_0`` is absent.** Its absence is load-bearing rather than tidy: it is
      what makes "not on the surface" structural, so a consumer joining results
      to the lookup cannot place the baseline on the surface by accident.
    - **The ``st_id`` width is UNIFORM.** The whole join-key inference rests on
      one width per table, so this is where that becomes a checked property
      rather than a documented one.
    - **``st_id`` is TEXT.** Read with inferred dtypes, ``01`` comes back as
      ``1``; a validator subject to the very hazard the contract names could not
      detect it.

#: **weathergenr 2.0.0 (2026-08-17).** One key changed here: ``relax_priority``
#: became ``relax_order`` and is now pinned, because the wrapper forwards it (see
#: the entry below). Every other section and key survives the major version
#: unchanged — the argument sets of ``run_weather_generator``,
#: ``generate_weather``, ``apply_climate_perturbations`` and ``write_netcdf``
#: were checked one by one against the 2.0.0 sources.
#:
#: 2.0.0 also weakened the FAILURE MODE this list guards, without weakening the
#: reason for it. ``run_weather_generator`` forwarded every ``config`` entry
#: unconditionally, so an absent one arrived as an explicit ``NULL`` that

#: choice, readable in one file — not that upstream would otherwise crash.
#:
#: Every key is pinned for the same reason the transient flags are: the R reads
#: it, and an omission silently substitutes whatever upstream defaults to. That
#: is the C34 defect, and a contract is how it stays fixed.

def validate_hm7(tables: dict, rlz_num: int | None = None, lookup=None) -> list[str]:
    """HM-7 — response-surface reduction, ONE LONG TABLE PER OUTPUT VARIABLE.

    ``tables`` maps variable token to parsed table (``{"q": df, "aet": df}``).
    ``rlz_num`` is optional; supply it to check the ``rlz_id`` domain.
    ``lookup`` is the parsed ``stress_test_lookup.csv``; supply it to check
    completeness and the ``st_0`` partition.

    **The header this asserts, exactly and in order:**

        metric, location, st_id, rlz_id, value

    R11 CR-2 replaced the two wide tables with a fixed SIX-column long shape
    (``metric, temp_change, precip_change, realization_id, location, value``);
    C28 added ``st_id`` to make it seven, and the 2026-08-11 owner ruling reordered
    those seven identifier-first and renamed ``realization_id`` to ``rlz_id``. The
    axis columns were then REMOVED, taking it to five. The counts in that sentence
    are the historical ones and are not a typo.

    **Removing them is the point rather than a simplification.** They held a
    month-length-weighted ANNUAL mean of the member's twelve monthly
    perturbations, which misreports any seasonal design -- +30% imposed in JJA is
    +7.6% on the axis -- and baking one collapse into the results made every other
    axis unrecoverable from them. The axis is now derived at reporting time from
    the lookup; the specification is the HM-7 record and the reference
    implementation is ``shared/surface_axes.py``.

    What has held throughout is the property that matters: the header no longer
    grows with the gauge count, which is why this validator can assert it exactly
    rather than by membership — the previous version had to widen to a membership
    test precisely because the shape was config-dependent in the wrong dimension.
    A reorder does not touch that property, which is why it is a cheap change.

    Three things it asserts that nothing else can:

    - **``metric`` agrees with the table it is in.** The composite carries the
      variable, so no ``variable`` column exists; the redundancy is safe only if
      something checks it, which is what normalisation would have given free.
    - **The vocabulary.** Enumerated since 2026-08-12. It was a pattern while the
      two return-level suffixes interpolated the ``Tpeak``/``Tlow`` config keys,
      because enumerating would have rejected every project whose return periods
      differed from the fixture's; those keys are now toolbox constants, so the
      set of legal names is closed.
    - **The grain invariant.** ``rlz_id = 0`` means pooled — a numeric
      sentinel in a numeric key column, which is safe only because no metric
      emits both grains. If that ever stops holding, the sentinel must become a
      string, and this check is what would catch it.

    Superseded and worth not re-deriving: the axis columns were spelled
    ``tavg``/``prcp`` until 2026-08-05, the repo's only violation of the
    ``precip``/``temp`` vocabulary. The ``RT_*.csv`` side tables are gone as of
    R9 P3 — no in-repo consumer, written via ``params`` rather than declared, so
    invisible to ``--dry-run``. Nothing replaces them.

    **C28 (R11 P2) added ``st_id`` alongside the perturbation columns**, ruled
    "at this stage" with an explicit revisit when a third dimension arrives. The
    revisit happened: the answer was to remove the axis columns rather than add a
    third, so ``st_id`` now stands alone as the member key and the header is
    fixed against the stress-dimension count. C28's second obligation — the
    writer refusing a design table carrying an axis this header cannot express —
    retires with them, because the header expresses no axis. The CONTRACT barrier
    stands: a new lookup column still needs a C28 ruling.

    **What the cache-drift check is replaced by.** With one artifact there is no
    second derivation to disagree with, so that whole failure class is eliminated
    structurally rather than left unchecked. Completeness survives, in BOTH
    directions and re-pointed at the lookup, together with the ``st_0``
    partition — expected in the tables, expected absent from the lookup. Those
    checks are skipped, not failed, when ``lookup`` is None: a caller that has
    only the tables can still assert everything else.

    Original pinned surface, for the record (design §5.3): ``q_indicators.csv``
    header ``statistic,temp_change,precip_change,<gauge-cols>``;
    ``basin_indicators.csv`` the axis plus one column per configured
    ``*_basavg`` variable.

    The gauge-location tie to HM-4/HM-5 is checked by the relational
    ``validate_hm_gauge_column_identity``, which post-CR-2 compares the
    ``location`` column's value set rather than the header's column set — the same
    invariant, expressed against a header that no longer varies.
