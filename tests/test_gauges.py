"""Resolving the names hydromt_wflow gave the user's gauges (shared/gauges.py).

The regression these pin, observed 2026-08-01 on a real basin: hydromt_wflow
renames the gauges basename ``output_locations`` -> ``output-locations``
(``wflow_base.py``, ``.replace("_", "-")``), three readers derived the name from
the FILENAME instead, and because every lookup was a membership test used as a
guard the user's four gauges vanished in silence — absent from the basin map, no
gauge hydrographs, no signature plots, and an EMPTY performance_metrics.csv,
while wflow's own output.csv carried all four correctly.
