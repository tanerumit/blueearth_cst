"""A cartographic template: any geographic raster, with map furniture.

One drawing function, ``plot_raster_map``, serves every map this toolbox makes.
What differs between a DEM, a rainfall field and a temperature field is a
``RasterStyle`` — palette, label, classification, whether the values are a
surface worth hillshading. Everything else a map needs is shared and lives
here: the graticule and frame, a latitude-corrected scale bar, a north arrow,
an auto-sized locator inset, and a side panel that stacks the colourbar over
the vector legend.

Adding a quantity is an entry in ``RASTER_STYLES``, not another plotting
function. That is the whole point of the split: rule 1.12's basin map and rule
1.13's three forcing maps were separate code with separate ideas of what a map
is, and the forcing maps had no furniture at all.

The two entry points, split along reading-vs-drawing, are elsewhere:
``shared.plot_map`` resolves a wflow model on disk into the layers this module
draws. Nothing here reads a file except the vendored basemap, and nothing here
knows what wflow is — so any raster on a geographic grid, from any source,
plots through it.

Three rules the whole module depends on, worth knowing before changing anything:

* Lengths are in PHYSICAL units (mm / inches / points). The figure is built at
  its final printed size, so a font size is the size it will be on the page.
  Raising ``RASTER_DPI`` makes the PNG bigger, NOT the type smaller.
* Positions inside the map are AXES FRACTIONS and may exceed 1 to sit outside
  it — that is how the side panel works. Positions of map furniture drawn in
  data space (the scale bar) are fractions of the map's own extent, so they
  hold for any basin.
* Anything assembled FROM a tunable is derived in a FUNCTION, never frozen into
  a module-level constant. A constant snapshots its inputs at import, so
  overriding the input afterwards would silently do nothing — which is exactly
  how ``dev/scripts/preview_basin_map.py`` drives this module.

# * Positions inside the map are AXES FRACTIONS (0 = left/bottom, 1 =
#   right/top) and can exceed 1 to sit outside the map — that is how the side
#   panel works. Positions of map furniture drawn in data space (the scale bar)
#   are fractions of the map's own extent, so they hold for any basin.

# --- page and export -------------------------------------------------------
#
# FIGURE_WIDTH_MM, MM_PER_INCH, RASTER_DPI, the FONT_SIZE_* names below marked
# "(shared)" and FONT_FAMILY are the TOOLBOX-WIDE settings, imported from
# `shared/plot_style.py` so every figure family agrees on them. Change one
# THERE to move every figure; rebind one here (which is what
# `dev/scripts/preview_basin_map.py --set` does) to move only the map. The
# import binds each name in THIS module's globals, so the drawing code below
# and the preview's `setattr` both keep working unchanged.
#
# What stays here is map furniture — the scale bar, north arrow, gauge labels
# and colourbar sizes, which no non-map figure reads. `plot_style`'s docstring
# carries the test for which side a new constant belongs on.

# --- typography ------------------------------------------------------------

#: Type sizes in POINTS at the printed width above. Applied through
#: ``rc_context`` so the process-wide rcParams the other plotting rules inherit
#: are left untouched. Raise every value together to scale the labelling; raise
#: one to re-balance it.
#:
#: **Every size here is map-scoped, including the three that `plot_style` also
#: defines.** Those three (BASE / TICK / LEGEND) were imported from there until
#: 2026-08-16 and are now declared HERE instead, one step smaller across the
#: board — because the sizes that read correctly on a series plot are too heavy
#: on a map, where the labelling competes with the picture rather than
#: annotating an empty axes. Owner's call after reading a real basin's output:
#: the graticule, the colourbar title and the legend all crowded the map.
#:
#: Declaring rather than shrinking `plot_style` is what keeps the change
#: SCOPED. Those constants are page-level and every figure family reads them,
#: so lowering them there would silently shrink the projections and evaluation
#: figures too — families nobody asked about and nobody would re-render to
#: check. The blast radius of this block is the cartographic template plus the
#: climate series that share its `_publication_rc`, which is the one family
#: these sizes were judged against.
#:
#: `FONT_SIZE_CAVEAT` deliberately stays shared: `climate_figures` imports it
#: straight from `plot_style` for the series footnote, so map-scoping it would
#: print the same sentence at two sizes in one folder.
FONT_SIZE_BASE = 6.5  #: fallback size; the axes title is derived from it (+1)
FONT_SIZE_TICK = 6.0  #: the coordinate graticule labels
FONT_SIZE_LEGEND = 6.0  #: legend entries and the legend's own title
FONT_SIZE_COLORBAR_LABEL = 6.5  #: the colourbar's title
FONT_SIZE_COLORBAR_TICK = 5.5  #: the numbers beside the colourbar
FONT_SIZE_GAUGE_LABEL = 5.5  #: the wflow_id beside each gauge marker
FONT_SIZE_SCALE_BAR = 5.5  #: the 0 / 2.5 / 5 km numbers
FONT_SIZE_NORTH_ARROW = 7.0  #: the "N"

# --- layout ----------------------------------------------------------------

#: Vertical room (inches) constrained layout needs for the x tick labels and the
#: axes furniture, on top of the map panel itself. Measured need is ~0.16 in of
#: tick labels; the rest is margin. Over-allowing here shows up directly as dead
#: space above and below an aspect-locked map.
_FURNITURE_HEIGHT_IN = 0.32

#: Horizontal room (inches) the y tick labels take on the left. Raise it if a
#: basin's coordinates need more decimal places than the default formatting.
_TICK_LABEL_WIDTH_IN = 0.5

#: Constrained layout owns the figure only up to here; the strip to the right is
#: a SIDE PANEL holding the colourbar and, beneath it, the legend. A GeoAxes has
#: a LOCKED aspect, so it does not fill its layout cell vertically — and
#: ``fig.colorbar(ax=ax)`` sizes to the CELL, which is what made the bar overhang
#: the map top and bottom. Both panel items are therefore anchored in AXES
#: coordinates (so they track the map exactly) and this rect reserves the room.
#: LOWER it to widen the panel (a longer legend entry needs more), RAISE it to
#: give the map more width.
_LAYOUT_RIGHT = 0.78

#: Keep pathological basin shapes from producing an unusable page. A basin
#: narrower or taller than these renders with whitespace rather than being
#: squashed or running off the figure.
_MIN_MAP_ASPECT, _MAX_MAP_ASPECT = 0.45, 1.45

#: Draw passes run before the figure is returned, so its layout is already
#: settled. Constrained layout converges in two here (measured); a third costs
#: ~0.2 s and changes nothing. Raise it only if a label still lands off-canvas.
_LAYOUT_SETTLE_PASSES = 2

# --- side panel: colourbar and legend --------------------------------------

#: Left edge of the side panel, in axes fractions (>1 = outside the map). The
#: colourbar and the legend BOTH start here — ONE value, so they cannot drift
#: out of alignment. Raise it to push the panel further from the map.
_PANEL_LEFT = 1.03

#: Colourbar geometry in axes fractions. ``HEIGHT`` is the BAR's own drawn
#: length, so it reads straight against a brief that asks for "60-70% of the
#: axis"; it is a MAXIMUM, since the bar gives way when the panel's other two
#: blocks need the room. There is no ``_COLORBAR_BOTTOM`` any more: the bar's
#: position is DERIVED from what the locator above it and the legend below it
#: leave, which is the only way the three can be guaranteed to fit the map's
#: height without a hand-tuned constant per combination.
_COLORBAR_WIDTH = 0.030
_COLORBAR_HEIGHT = 1.50
#: The bar never shrinks below this, even if that overruns the panel. A bar too
#: short to carry its own tick labels is not a smaller bar, it is a broken one —
#: better to overflow visibly than to render something unreadable.
_COLORBAR_MIN_HEIGHT = 0.18
_COLORBAR_OUTLINE_WIDTH = 0.5

#: Where the colourbar's label goes. ``"right"`` is matplotlib's own placement
#: for a vertical bar: alongside it, rotated 90°. ``"top"`` puts it above the
#: bar, HORIZONTAL and left-aligned to the bar's left edge — which is
#: ``_PANEL_LEFT``, the legend's anchor too, so the two line up. Prefer "top"
#: for a long label: rotated text is slower to read and a unit string in
#: brackets reads badly on its side.
COLORBAR_LABEL_POSITION = "top"

#: Gap between the bar and a "top" label, in points.
_COLORBAR_TITLE_PAD = 5.0

#: Height reserved for a "top" label, in axes fractions PER LINE of it. The bar
#: keeps its declared length and is pushed DOWN when the label would otherwise
#: run off the canvas — the earlier behaviour shortened the bar instead, which
#: silently broke the "the bar is N% of the axis" contract the height states.
#: Per line, because the label wraps: a two-line label needs twice the room, and
#: a fixed value would either clip the second line or leave a gap above a
#: one-line one.
_COLORBAR_TOP_LABEL_HEADROOM = 0.055

#: The values ``COLORBAR_LABEL_POSITION`` accepts.
_COLORBAR_LABEL_POSITIONS = ("right", "top")
#: Upper and lower quantiles of the DEM the ramp spans. The upper clip stops a
#: single high pixel flattening the rest of the basin to one colour.
_ELEVATION_CLIP_QUANTILES = (0.0, 0.98)

#: Target number of colour CLASSES. The ramp is stepped rather than continuous:
#: a reader cannot resolve a shade back to a number off a smooth ramp, but can
#: off a class, and stepped classes survive the greyscale print that a
#: continuous ramp turns to mush. The count is a target — the class WIDTH is
#: rounded to a ladder value first, so the boundaries are numbers worth printing
#: and the count lands near this rather than on it.
_COLORBAR_LEVELS = 6

#: Hard cap on the number of TICK LABELS on the bar — one per class boundary, so
#: a bar of N classes carries N+1 of them. The target above is a wish; this is
#: enforced, by widening the step until the count fits. Both exist because
#: rounding the class width to a readable number means the count cannot be
#: dialled in exactly: asking for 4 classes over a 0-140 m range yields 4 or 3
#: depending on which ladder rung the width lands on, and only the cap
#: guarantees the bar never comes back with eight.
_COLORBAR_MAX_TICKS = 9

#: How many times the step may be widened chasing that cap before the result is
#: taken as it stands. A bound, not a tuning knob: each rung roughly doubles the
#: step, so this covers a range of 10^3 and exists only so a pathological DEM
#: cannot spin here.
_STEP_WIDEN_ATTEMPTS = 12

#: Start the ramp at 0 m rather than at the basin's own lowest cell. Elevation
#: is measured from a datum, so a bar starting at 4 m invites the reader to
#: treat the basin floor as the zero of the scale. Set False to always spend the
#: whole ramp on the basin's actual range.
_ELEVATION_STARTS_AT_ZERO = True

#: ...but not when it would cost the map its resolution. A 1900-1960 m plateau
#: zeroed gets classes 0/500/1000/1500/2000 — the ENTIRE basin lands in one of
#: them and the map renders as a single flat colour. So the baseline drops to
#: zero only while the basin's own range stays at least this fraction of the
#: zero-based range; below it, the ramp starts at the basin's floor instead.
#: CST runs on lowland deltas and Himalayan headwaters from the same code, and
#: a rule tuned on one of them is not a rule.
#: Raised from 0.35 in 2026-08: at 0.35 a 1900-4200 m headwater still zeroed,
#: which spent the lowest class on ground the basin does not contain and left
#: 44% of its cells in one class. Measured on synthetic archetypes, not guessed.
_ZERO_BASELINE_MIN_SPAN_FRACTION = 0.70

# --- elevation classification ----------------------------------------------
# Equal-interval classes are the right default and the wrong answer on a skewed
# DEM. The fixture is the case: 1.5-215 m, median 10 m, so 0/20/40/.../140 puts
# 73% of the basin in ONE class and leaves three classes empty — the map renders
# as blank paper and the ramp does no work. Equal-AREA (quantile) classes fix
# that but read as arbitrary numbers, so the breaks are snapped onto a readable
# ladder. Which rule applies is decided per basin from the DEM's own histogram,
# because CST runs on deltas and on headwaters from this same code.

#: Which rule sets the class boundaries.
#:
#: * ``"equal_interval"`` — evenly spaced classes on a round step, always. The
#:   bar is then a linear scale: a reader can step up it in equal metres, and
#:   two classes are always the same number of metres apart. This is the
#:   default, and it is what most readers assume an elevation bar is.
#: * ``"auto"`` — equal-interval unless the DEM's own histogram says it is not
#:   working (see ``_MAX_CLASS_AREA_SHARE``), then equal-AREA classes snapped to
#:   a readable ladder. Differentiates a skewed basin far better; costs the
#:   linear reading.
#:
#: The trade is real in both directions and depends on the basin, which is why
#: both rules are kept rather than one being deleted.
ELEVATION_CLASSIFICATION = "equal_interval"
_ELEVATION_CLASSIFICATIONS = ("equal_interval", "auto")

#: Equal-interval is kept while no class holds more than this share of the
#: basin's cells AND no class is empty. Above it, the equal-area rule takes
#: over. Consulted only when ``ELEVATION_CLASSIFICATION == "auto"``.
_MAX_CLASS_AREA_SHARE = 0.40

#: A class holding less than this share counts as empty for that test.
_EMPTY_CLASS_AREA_SHARE = 0.01

#: Never fall to fewer classes than this. Snapping equal-area breaks onto the
#: ladder can collapse neighbours on a tightly-clustered DEM; below this count
#: the equal-interval breaks are the better of two imperfect answers.
_MIN_CLASSES = 4

#: Mantissas of the readable break ladder, spanning one decade. ~30% spacing:
#: fine enough that a quantile lands near a rung, coarse enough that every rung
#: is a number worth printing on a bar. Equal-area breaks snap onto it.
_BREAK_LADDER = (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0)

#: Gap between the colourbar's lower end and the top of the legend box, in axes
#: fractions. The legend's position is DERIVED from the bar's rather than being
#: a second hand-tuned constant: the two used to be pinned independently, so
#: changing the bar's length silently moved it into the legend.
_LEGEND_GAP = 0.05

#: Row pitch of the legend, as a multiple of ``FONT_SIZE_LEGEND``. Used to
#: PREDICT the legend's height before it is drawn, so the colourbar above it can
#: be sized to what is left. matplotlib does not report a legend's extent until
#: after a draw, and by then the bar's inset axes is already placed — so the
#: height is estimated from the entry count instead. Raise it if a long legend
#: starts to crowd the bar; the estimate only has to be close.
_LEGEND_ROW_FACTOR = 1.55
_LEGEND_FRAME_ALPHA = 0.85  #: 1.0 = opaque, 0.0 = no fill
_LEGEND_FRAME_WIDTH = 0.5  #: border weight, points
_LEGEND_BORDER_PAD = 0.4  #: padding inside the frame, in font units
_LEGEND_HANDLE_LENGTH = 1.4  #: length of the sample line/marker, in font units
#: ``None`` drops the title row. Titled since 2026-08-16, and the wording is
#: why: "Legend" would label the obvious and cost a row of the panel's height
#: for nothing, which is why the row was dropped originally. What the row earns
#: its place saying is what KIND of thing the entries are — the panel stacks a
#: colourbar over this block, and both are keys, so the reader is otherwise
#: left to infer that one describes the raster and the other the linework over
#: it. "Map features" names the second half of that pair.
_LEGEND_TITLE = "Map features"

#: Legend wording, one place. These are what the READER sees, so they are the
#: domain's words rather than the model's internals: "output locs" was the
#: config key ``output_locations`` abbreviated to fit, which names a wflow
#: concept and not a thing on the ground. Keep them short — the side panel is
#: about 40 mm wide and a longer entry pushes ``_LAYOUT_RIGHT``.

# --- colours ---------------------------------------------------------------

#: One place for every hue on the figure. The blue is used for BOTH the rivers

COLOR_RIVER = "#2c6fad"
COLOR_GAUGE = "#2c6fad"
COLOR_OUTLET = "k"
COLOR_BASIN_OUTLINE = "k"
#: Subcatchment divides. Darkened from "0.45": a light grey hairline is legible
#: over white and disappears over the mid-browns of the elevation ramp, which is
#: most of the map. Contrast alone was not enough — the divides also carry a
#: halo (``HALO_WIDTH_SUBCATCHMENT``), which is what makes a 0.6 pt line hold
#: against ANY terrain colour underneath it rather than only against pale ones.
COLOR_SUBCATCHMENT = "0.15"

COLOR_MARKER_EDGE = "white"

COLOR_HALO = "white"

}

#: A monotonic-lightness elevation ramp, hand-built rather than imported: the
#: perceptually-uniform terrain colormaps (cmcrameri, cmocean) are not in the
#: pixi env and adding a dependency for one figure is not warranted. Lightness
#: falls monotonically from low to high ground, so the ramp survives greyscale
#: printing AND every dichromacy — the two failure modes `terrain` had. Replace
#: it only with another ramp whose lightness is monotonic; a test enforces that.
_DEM_ANCHORS = ("#f6f2ea", "#e3d5ba", "#c9aa7d", "#a07f52", "#6f5533", "#46351f")

# --- line weights (points) -------------------------------------------------

#: River width scales with Strahler stream order, between these two bounds. The
#: minimum is what a headwater gets, the maximum the trunk — widen the gap for a
#: more dramatic network, narrow it for a flatter, more uniform one.
#: 0.2 pt is below what most printers hold and vanishes on screen at any
#: reasonable zoom, so the headwaters of the network simply were not there.
RIVER_WIDTH_MIN = 0.5
RIVER_WIDTH_MAX = 1.4
#: Used when every river shares one stream order, so there is nothing to scale.
RIVER_WIDTH_UNIFORM = 0.6

WIDTH_BASIN_OUTLINE = 0.9  #: the dissolved outer boundary — the map's key line
#: Internal divides. Still lighter than the basin outline — that hierarchy is

#: reads on screen at all over textured ground.
WIDTH_SUBCATCHMENT = 0.7
WIDTH_WATERBODY_EDGE = 0.5
WIDTH_MARKER_EDGE = 0.4

_CATEGORY_SWATCH_EDGE_WIDTH = 0.4
WIDTH_AXES_SPINE = 0.6
WIDTH_GRATICULE = 0.3
#: Dash pattern for the subcatchment divides, matplotlib ``(offset, (on, off))``.

#: IS dotted.
DASH_SUBCATCHMENT = (0, (6, 2.5))
#: Halo stroke widths, points. The halo must exceed the line it protects.
HALO_WIDTH_TEXT = 2.5
HALO_WIDTH_GAUGE_LABEL = 1.8
#: Halo behind the subcatchment divides. Narrowed from 1.6 once the template
#: started drawing SATURATED rasters: over the pale elevation ramp a wide halo
#: is invisible, but over a dark red temperature field it became the thing you
#: see — the divides read as WHITE dashes with dark edges, the inverse of the
#: intended styling. It must stay wide enough to separate the line and narrow
#: enough that the line, not the ring, is what reads.
HALO_WIDTH_SUBCATCHMENT = 1.25

# --- markers ---------------------------------------------------------------

#: Separate shapes for the two point layers. They were both thin diamonds,
#: separated by colour alone — which fails in greyscale, fails for a
#: dichromat, and is hard to tell apart at 5 pt anyway. Shape is the redundant
#: channel that fixes all three. Circle reads as a measurement point, square as
#: a structural one; swap them if a convention says otherwise.
MARKER_SHAPE_GAUGE = "o"
MARKER_SHAPE_OUTLET = "s"
#: matplotlib points-squared, as geopandas expects. 18 was ~4.2 pt across at
#: 180 mm, which disappears against the relief; 44 is ~6.6 pt.
MARKER_SIZE = 44
#: Offset of a gauge's label from its marker, in points (x, y). Must clear the
#: marker's RADIUS: at MARKER_SIZE 44 that is ~3.3 pt, and the old (2.5, 2.5)
#: put the text inside the symbol.
GAUGE_LABEL_OFFSET = (4.5, 3.5)

# --- graticule -------------------------------------------------------------

#: ``"box"`` closes the map on all four sides — the frame a reader expects
#: around a map panel, and what keeps the DEM's own edge from reading as the
#: panel's edge. ``"L"`` draws only the two labelled sides, which is the plot

_SCALE_BAR_WIDTH_FRACTION = 0.25
#: VERTICAL inset of the bar from its chosen corner, as a fraction of the map
#: extent. The horizontal one is ``_FURNITURE_INSET_X``, shared with the north
#: arrow — see there.
_SCALE_BAR_INSET_Y = 0.06
#: Which corner the bar takes, or ``"auto"`` for the emptiest one left after the
#: north arrow and the locator have been placed. Pinned to lower left so the
#: figure's furniture sits where a reader expects it on EVERY basin — an
#: auto-placed bar that moves corner between two basins makes two maps of the
#: same study harder to compare, which is the cost the auto rule was not paying
#: attention to. Set "auto" to get the old behaviour back.
_SCALE_BAR_CORNER = "lower left"
#: Gap between the bar and its numbers, as a fraction of the latitude span.
_SCALE_BAR_LABEL_GAP = 0.008
_SCALE_BAR_EDGE_WIDTH = 0.5

# --- north arrow -----------------------------------------------------------

#: Horizontal inset of the map's left-hand furniture — the north arrow and the
#: scale bar — as a fraction of the map extent. ONE value for both, so the two
#: line up on the same vertical by construction. They were on 0.035 and 0.06,
#: close enough to look like a mistake rather than a choice; a shared constant
#: is what stops them drifting apart again the next time one is nudged.
#: (An axes fraction and an extent fraction are the same thing here: the panel
#: is PlateCarree with an explicit extent.)
_FURNITURE_INSET_X = 0.05

#: Arrow position in axes fractions: (tip y, tail y). The "N" sits at the tail;
#: the arrow's x comes from ``_FURNITURE_INSET_X``. Exactly vertical is correct
#: here because PlateCarree's north is up. Tucked into the map's own top-LEFT
#: corner: the locator inset owns the top right.
_NORTH_ARROW_POSITION = (0.985, 0.885)
_NORTH_ARROW_STYLE = "-|>"
_NORTH_ARROW_WIDTH = 0.8
#: The arrow's corner. Stated separately from the position because the corner
#: budget reads it — the position is where the artist is drawn, this is which
#: corner is spoken for.
_NORTH_ARROW_CORNER = "upper left"

# --- locator inset ---------------------------------------------------------
# A small map in a corner saying WHERE this basin is: land and sea, country
# lines, a few major cities, and a mark on the basin. It is an INSET rather
# than a widened frame on purpose — the elevation map keeps the whole panel and
# its own scale, and a basin with nothing within 500 km still gets an answer,
# which a zoomed-out background could not give.

#: Draw it at all. The layers come from a vendored Natural Earth extract
#: (``config/basemap/``); with that file absent the inset is skipped and a note
#: is printed, so a copy of this module taken to another project still renders.

#:
#: Auto, because a fixed value cannot serve two basins of different sizes now
#: that the inset draws the real polygon rather than a centroid mark. The window
#: has to be wide enough to place the basin against something a reader knows,
#: and narrow enough that the basin is more than a few points across — and where
#: that balance falls depends entirely on how big the basin is. A fixed 8 deg
#: put this fixture's 0.24 deg basin at 1.5% of the frame, a speck; the same
#: 8 deg would make a 6 deg basin fill the window and show no context at all.
#: Set a number to pin it.
_LOCATOR_SPAN_DEG = "auto"

#: What "well distinguishable" means, as the basin's long axis over the window's
#: width. 3% is the measured answer on this fixture: it is what a 4 deg
#: half-width gives, and 4 deg is the width that reads as a shape while keeping
#: the coast, the country and the nearest capital in frame.
_LOCATOR_TARGET_BASIN_FRACTION = 0.03

#: Half-widths the auto rule may choose, in degrees. A ladder rather than a

#: is real and was the reason for "auto": the inset is OPAQUE, so a pinned
#: corner can cover basin the reader wanted — on this fixture it lands on the
#: basin's highest ground. ``_LOCATOR_PLACEMENT = "panel"`` is the way out that
#: keeps the position fixed AND covers nothing.
_LOCATOR_CORNER = "upper right"

#: Where the inset is drawn: ``"map"`` puts it in a corner OF THE MAP, over the
#: basin; ``"panel"`` puts it at the top of the side panel, above the colourbar,
#: where it covers nothing. "panel" costs the colourbar some length and reads
#: slightly less as "this window contains that map"; "map" costs whatever basin
#: it lands on. Both are defensible — this is the knob to compare, not to guess.
#: "panel" chosen 2026-08-09: on the map it covered the fixture's highest ground,
#: and the panel stacks locator/colourbar/legend into the map's own height.
_LOCATOR_PLACEMENT = "panel"

_LOCATOR_PANEL_WIDTH = 0.315
#: Gap between the panel inset's bottom and the colourbar's label, axes fractions.
#: Trimmed with the +10% inset: the panel's three blocks are stacked to fit the
#: map's height exactly, so the room the inset gains has to come from somewhere,
#: and a gap is cheaper to give up than the colourbar's length.
_LOCATOR_PANEL_GAP = 0.05
#: Cap on the panel inset's height. A wide, short basin makes the square inset
#: TALL in axes fractions (the box is square on the page, not in the fraction
#: space), and an uncapped one would take half the panel from the colourbar.
#: This is what actually SETS the inset's size on a basin wider than it is tall
#: (the fixture is one), so it and ``_LOCATOR_PANEL_WIDTH`` are raised together
#: — changing only the width would do nothing there.
_LOCATOR_PANEL_MAX_HEIGHT = 0.315

_AZIMUTH_DEG, _ALTITUDE_DEG = 315.0, 45.0

#: Target 90th-percentile terrain slope AFTER exaggeration, ~19 deg — steep

#: exaggeration factor is derived per basin: CST runs on lowland deltas and on
#: Himalayan headwaters from the same code, and any FIXED factor renders one of

#: ``"bilinear"`` smooths it into something that READS as terrain but is partly
#: invented: nothing between cell centres was ever measured. Use "none" when the

# --- data / labels ---------------------------------------------------------
# These three are the DEFAULTS of ``plot_basin_map`` parameters, so a caller

#: that lets a reader join this map to a hydrograph. ``station_name`` is longer,
#: collides more, and answers a question the caption can answer instead — swap
#: it here if the names matter more than the join.
GAUGE_LABEL_COLUMN = "wflow_id"

#: Clip the river network to the basin before drawing it. The engine-neutral
#: river layer is the REGIONAL network, so unclipped it runs well past the
#: study area — context the map did not ask for, and on a study-area figure
#: it reads as the basin outline failing to contain its own hydrography.
#: The raster is already clipped to the basin; this makes the vectors agree.
#: A no-op where the layer is already in-basin, as the wflow model's is.
CLIP_RIVERS_TO_BASIN = True

#: Column whose values scale the river line weights. ``strord`` is wflow's

#: frame does not carry, draws every reach at ``RIVER_WIDTH_UNIFORM``.
RIVER_ORDER_COLUMN = "strord"

#: Colourbar label. Units are the DEM's, so change it with the DEM. One line:
#: the label is left-aligned to the bar's own left edge, which is the panel's
#: anchor, so it runs into the panel's width rather than past it — and a
#: one-line label gives the bar back the axes fraction the second line cost.
ELEVATION_LABEL = "Elevation (m a.s.l.)"

#: Padding around the mapped footprint, as a fraction of its longitude and
#: latitude spans. Each axis is padded independently so a long, narrow basin
#: does not acquire excessive whitespace along its short axis.

    "Precipitation (mm y-1)" was not, leaving two figures a reader compares
    side by side with their bars at different heights and their titles in
    different shapes. Splitting always costs one line on the short ones and

    a long quantity name still has to fit the panel it is left-aligned to.
    Wrapping is MEASURED rather than guessed at a character count, because the
    width that matters is the panel's and a character estimate cannot know the

    A label with no parenthesised unit is wrapped and nothing more — it yields
    one line when it fits. Every style in ``RASTER_STYLES`` carries a unit, so

    Every layer is its own argument, and every argument but the first three is
    optional — so this plots ANY basin, from any source, not only a wflow model
    on disk. It reads no files, writes no files and returns the figure; saving
    is the caller's decision. ``plot_basin_map_from_model`` is the wrapper that
    supplies these arguments from a wflow model directory.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dem : xarray.DataArray
        2-D elevation on a GEOGRAPHIC grid (EPSG:4326). Its coordinates set the
        default extent and its values drive both the colour ramp and the
        hillshade, whose vertical exaggeration is derived per basin. Cells
        outside the basin should be NaN — they are drawn transparent.
    rivers : geopandas.GeoDataFrame
        The river network (LineStrings). Line weight scales with
        ``river_order_column`` when the frame carries it.
    basin : geopandas.GeoDataFrame
        The OUTER boundary, already dissolved to what should be drawn as the
        map's heaviest line. Pass ``_basin_outline(subcatchments)`` if you hold
        one polygon per subcatchment — drawing those at boundary weight makes an
        internal divide indistinguishable from the basin outline, which is the
        one line on this figure a reader has to be able to trust.
    subbasins : geopandas.GeoDataFrame, optional
        Internal subcatchment divides, drawn lighter and dashed beneath the
        outline. Omit for a basin with no meaningful internal division; nothing
        is drawn and no legend entry appears.
    gauges, outlets : geopandas.GeoDataFrame, optional
        Point layers. Gauges take the river colour (they sit on the network);
        outlets stay black (they belong to the model). Gauges are annotated with
        ``gauge_label_column`` when the frame has it.
    lakes, reservoirs, glaciers : geopandas.GeoDataFrame, optional
        Filled polygon layers, each with its own colours from
        ``WATERBODY_COLORS``.
    extent : sequence of float, optional
        ``[lon_min, lon_max, lat_min, lat_max]``. Defaults to the DEM's own
        bounding box plus proportional padding. Set it to frame several basins
        alike, or to crop.
    gauge_label_column : str or None
        Column annotated beside each gauge; ``None`` draws the markers unlabelled.
    river_order_column : str or None
        Numeric column scaling the river widths; ``None`` or an absent column
        draws every reach at ``RIVER_WIDTH_UNIFORM``.
    style : RasterStyle, optional
        Palette, label, classification and relief for the quantity being drawn.
        Defaults to ``RASTER_STYLES["elevation"]``. This is the one argument
        that makes the figure a template: everything else on it — furniture,
        panel stack, legend, graticule, locator — is the same for any raster.
    title, caveat : str, optional
        Figure title and footnote, drawn through ``suptitle``/``supxlabel`` so
        constrained layout reserves room for them.
    expected_units : sequence of str, optional
        Units the label claims. A mismatch warns; see ``check_geographic_inputs``.
    vector_legend : bool
        Whether the OVERLAY layers — rivers, boundary, divides, points — get
        legend entries. The layers are drawn either way; this governs only
        whether they are explained.

        ``False`` is for a SET of figures over one basin, where the overlay is
        identical on every sheet and one figure in the set already carries the
        key. Repeating four entries on thirteen maps costs panel height that a
        land-cover legend needs and teaches the reader nothing after the first
        sheet. A raster's own classes are never suppressed by this — they are
        the figure's subject, not its furniture.

    Returns
