"""Size WF3's Wflow batches against the disk they will actually fill.

Rule 3.15 runs ``B`` Wflow members per Julia session. Both of the sweep's
``temp()`` classes -- rule 3.14's per-member forcing NC and 3.15's own
per-member outstates NC -- are held for a whole batch rather than a whole
member, and Snakemake keeps ``p`` batch jobs in flight at ``-c N``. So peak
transient disk is ``p x B x (forcing + state)``: raising ``B`` for throughput
buys that throughput with disk.

P3-3 design section 6.1 calls this the **binding** constraint on large
``RLZ_NUM x ST_NUM`` runs, and the landed default did not implement it. It was
``ceil(K / -c N)`` -- the *parallelism* ceiling alone -- which scales ``B`` UP
with sweep size and therefore grows peak disk as the sweep grows, backwards
from what the disk ceiling asks. Commit ``3392587`` bounded the blast radius
with a constant ``batch_size_max`` (default 8), which is a clamp, not a disk
computation: on a real basin ``8`` can still be tens of gigabytes, and nothing
consulted the free space it was about to spend.

This module supplies the missing term.

Estimating a member BEFORE it exists
------------------------------------
The obvious anchor is a per-member forcing NC, and it is unavailable: those are
``temp()`` outputs that do not exist at parse time and are reclaimed as the run
proceeds. Modelling the size instead (grid cells x run length x variable count
x dtype) means predicting NetCDF's compressed size, which no arithmetic here
can do honestly.

So the estimate is **measured, not modelled**, off two artifacts WF1 leaves on
disk permanently -- the same model, the same grid, the same writer:

===============  ==================================================  ============
quantity         anchor                                              scaling
===============  ==================================================  ============
forcing          ``<basin>/forcing/inmaps_historical.nc``             by timestep
state            ``<basin>/run_default/outstate/outstates.nc``        none
===============  ==================================================  ============

The forcing anchor works because both files carry the same three variables on
the same grid at the same dtype through the same zlib level, chunked one
timestep at a time -- so bytes-per-timestep is a property of the MODEL, not of
the window, and a member's size is that constant times its own timestep count.
Measured on the rapid fixture (2026-08-18): the historical file is 1379
bytes/timestep and a member's is 1378, a 0.07 % difference; predicting the
4.530 MB member from the 3.527 MB historical file lands within 0.07 %.

The state anchor needs no scaling at all: outstates is a single snapshot of the
model's state variables, so its size is set by the grid and is independent of
how long the run was.

Both anchors are the WF1 model's own files, so they cannot describe a different
grid than the members will use. If either is missing -- a fresh project, a
``--dry-run`` before WF1 has ever run -- the estimate is simply unavailable and
the disk ceiling does not apply. **This is a safety cap, so it never raises and
never blocks**: an unavailable estimate degrades to the previous behaviour
rather than becoming a new way for a run to fail.
