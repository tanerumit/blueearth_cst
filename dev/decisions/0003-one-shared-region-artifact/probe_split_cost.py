"""Measure ADR 0003 §8's acceptance gate: is the vector half materially cheaper?

§8 splits `prepare_spatial_maps` so WF2 and WF3 can declare only the vector half.
The whole decision rests on an **unmeasured** claim: that the hydrography read
plus delineation costs materially less than the thematic raster stack it leaves
behind. If it does not, WF2 pays roughly what declaring the unsplit rule would
have cost, the split bought nothing, and the simpler "declare it unsplit"
alternative wins.

So this times the two halves exactly as `prepare_spatial_products` calls them:

* **vector half** — hydrography raster read, `prepare_hydrography`, parent-basin
  delineation, gauge snapping, subbasin partitioning, rivers geodataframe;
* **thematic half** — `_thematic_maps`, i.e. the LULC / LAI / soil reads and
  their reprojections onto the model grid.

Read-only: it opens catalog sources and writes nothing but the region GeoJSON,
into a temp dir. It is **not** a pipeline run — no Snakemake state, no
`project_dir`, so it is safe to run from a worktree.

    pixi run python dev/decisions/0003-one-shared-region-artifact/probe_split_cost.py

Defaults to the tracked test config's region so the number is reproducible.
Pass `--config` to time a larger, more realistic basin — the ratio is what the
gate turns on, and a small basin may flatter both halves.
