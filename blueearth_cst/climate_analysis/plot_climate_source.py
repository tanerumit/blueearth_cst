"""Source-grid climate figures from the shared climate store (R07 B4 / P4).

Rule ``plot_climate_source``'s script (``build_model.smk`` 1.15 — a
single declaration; none of B1's two-DAG machinery applies). It answers *"what
does the source climate look like?"* from the store alone, so its whole
subgraph is the B1 producer (whose sole input is the tracked data catalog) plus
itself: the three figures build with **neither** ``models/hydrology/wflow/``
**nor**
``config/defaults/wflow_build_model.yml`` on disk. That is the P4 assertion,
pinned by ``tests/test_plot_climate_source.py``.

Three climate-figure families coexist (design § B4). This module owns the first
and rule 1.13 owns the second, and since 2026-08 BOTH are drawn by the same
canonical set (``climate_figures``) so the two are directly comparable — every
filename is prefixed by its dataset, because a bare ``pet.png`` copied into a
report or picked up by a GUI collector loses its parent directory and the two
are **deliberately different** values:

================================  ======  ============================================
Product                           Grid    Home
================================  ======  ============================================
source climate (this module)      source  ``data/climate/historical/<key>/plots/``
forcing / model-input QA (1.13)   model   ``models/hydrology/wflow/forcing/plots/``
model-parity climate (rule 1.11)  model   ``models/hydrology/wflow/evaluation/plots/``
================================  ======  ============================================

The third stays outside the canonical set: it is keyed by STATION rather than by
grid and answers a different question (climate beside the discharge it drove).

**Source-grid PET need not match the build's PET, by design.** These are
approximate quick assessments computed on the extraction grid against the
*source* orography; the build's PET is the refined model input, derived on the
model grid. The figures say so on their face — which is exactly what the
canonical set makes readable, since the same figure now exists on both sides.

Plain matplotlib only: no cartopy basemap tiles, so the rule needs no network.

    Parameters
    ----------
    climate_nc : str | Path
        ``data/climate/historical/<key>/extract_historical.nc`` — the store's
        extraction (rule 0.04 / 1.04 / 3.08 ``extract_historical_climate``).
    plot_dir : str | Path
        ``data/climate/historical/<key>/plots/``. Created if absent.
    oro_nc : str | Path, optional
        chirps / chirps_global only: the store's declared ``orography.nc``
        sidecar. None on era5, where the orography comes from the catalog.
    data_sources : str | Path, optional
        hydromt data catalog(s). Required on the era5 branch (``era5_orography``).
    clim_source : str
        ``shared.clim_historical``; recorded in the log for traceability.
    geoms_dir : str | Path, optional
        ``data/spatial/geoms/`` — the ENGINE-NEUTRAL vector foundation from rule
        1.03. Supplies the basin outline, subcatchment divides, river network
        and points of interest the maps are drawn over. Optional, and
        model-independent by construction: this rule runs off the climate store
        and must not wait on a wflow build to plot the source climate.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the extraction is missing any variable the PET workflow needs. This
        is deliberately loud: the rule declares three outputs, so a silent skip
        would surface as an opaque ``MissingOutputException`` instead.
