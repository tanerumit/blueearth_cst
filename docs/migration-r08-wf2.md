# Migration — workflow 2 (R8, `v2.0` of the climate-projections workflow)

Workflow 2 was restructured in milestone R8. **Three config changes are breaking**
and fail loudly at DAG build; everything else is additive or a value change you
should know about.

Design rationale: `dev/milestones/r08/wf2-climate-analysis-v2-design.md`.
Step-by-step evidence: the falsifier notes under `dev/milestones/r08/`.

---

## Breaking config changes

### 1. `variables` is a mapping, not a list

```yaml
# before
variables: [precip, temp]

# after
variables:
  precip: {source: precip, canonical: rate,  units: mm/day, change: relative}
  temp:   {source: temp,   canonical: state, units: degC,   change: absolute}
```

`canonical` says whether the stored monthly series is a *rate* or a *state* — it
drives the annual aggregation. `change` says whether a change factor is a ratio or
a difference — it drives the arithmetic. Previously **both** were inferred from
the literal name `"precip"`, so any other relative variable was silently
differenced as if it were a temperature.

A `change: relative` variable outside the shipped set must also declare a
near-zero threshold (see the `relative_change` keys below).

### 2. `save_grids` / `save_gridded` are removed

```yaml
# delete this line, whichever spelling you have
save_gridded: false
```

The key was renamed `save_grids` → `save_gridded` during this milestone and then
removed outright; if you are migrating from before R8, skip the rename and just
delete the line. The gridded outputs are gone. `raw/{series_key}.nc` **is** the basin slice on the
source grid and is written on every run, so `grids/series/` would have been a
near-duplicate of a file you already have; `grids/change/` was never declared to
Snakemake by any rule.

`save_gridded: true` (or the older `save_grids: true`) now **raises** — it asks
for an output that no longer exists. `false` is accepted with a warning, because
it requests exactly what the workflow now always does; delete the key at your
convenience.

### 3. A model absent from the catalog now fails at DAG build

The CMIP6 catalog is generated from a live crawl of the store, so a model name
absent from it is absent from the store. That is a typo or a stale config, not
thin data, and it stops the run naming the model.

A model that is *present* but does not publish a requested scenario or member is
**not** an error: it is recorded in `composition.csv` with a status and the run
continues. See "New outputs" below.

---

## New config keys (all optional)

| Key | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `stats` | `[mean, median, std]` | The statistic set. Tail quantiles are opt-in and, when emitted, labelled with their effective sample size (`q_90[n=21]`). |
| `relative_change.min_reference` | `{precip: 0.1}` mm/day | Below this, a month's *relative* change is undefined and is reported as `NaN` with `status = reference_below_threshold`; its absolute change is kept. |
| `relative_change.max_flagged_months` | `3` | More than this many flagged months flags the whole combination in the report. |

---

## Values changed

If you compare results across this milestone, expect differences from four
deliberate changes. Each landed as its own commit with its own gate.

| Change | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| **Spherical cell-area weighting** (5a) | The basin mean weights each cell by its true area. **No effect on an equatorial, latitude-symmetric basin** — where the weights are exactly uniform — and a growing effect with latitude. |
| **Calendar-aware month weighting** (5b) | Annual aggregates weight each month by its length *in the model's own calendar*. Zero effect on a `360_day` model; real on `noleap` and standard. |
| **Rounding dropped** (5c) | Stage A no longer rounds to 2 decimals — that was a 0.005 mm/day floor on every monthly value. Distinct from the 3 dp the summary CSVs are *written* at (see "Number formatting in the CSVs"): that is presentation, this was the stored series. |
| **Reference window off-by-one fixed** | A configured `[1990, 2010]` now yields **21** complete hydrological years, not 20. The final complete year was being discarded. This is the largest of the four. |

Two provenance corrections also landed: series now record the model's **true
calendar** (previously every series claimed `proleptic_gregorian`, which is false
for every `noleap` and `360_day` model), and the effective reference window is
reported consistently everywhere it appears.

---

## New outputs

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `summary/cmip6_change_factors_annual.csv` | Long format: one row per (model, scenario, member, horizon, variable, statistic). Schema below. |
| `summary/cmip6_change_factors_monthly.csv` | The same, per calendar month — the seasonal shift an annual figure averages away. |
| `summary/composition.csv` | Every **requested** combination and how it resolved, including the ones that do not exist in the store. |
| `summary/provenance.json` | Sources with verified physical store paths, digests, windows, settings — enough to reconstruct the run. |
| `report.md` | The run with a disclaimer block: window clipping, alignment, weighting scheme and its approximation, the dry-month rule, catalog snapshot date, unresolved combinations. |

The wide `summary/annual_change_scalar_stats_summary*` files are **no longer
produced** — see "Rebuilt tables" below.

## Renamed paths

| Before | After | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `series/{key}.nc` | `scalar/{key}.nc` | `series` said nothing about the files being spatially averaged. `scalar` is the word this codebase already uses for the quantity (`var_m_scalar` in the reducer), on the axis it already asserts — scalar vs grid. |
| `change_factors/annual.csv` | `summary/cmip6_change_factors_annual.csv` | Every result now lives under `summary/`, and the name identifies the file when it is detached from the tree. |
| `change_factors/monthly.csv` | `summary/cmip6_change_factors_monthly.csv` | |
| `provenance.json` | `summary/provenance.json` | Beside `composition.csv` — both are run-level records rather than results. `report.md` stays at the root as the single entry point. |
| `projected_climate_statistics.png` | `plots/cmip6_change_factor_cloud.png` | It is the ΔT/ΔP cloud, one point per combination. |
| `{precipitation,temperature}_{anomaly,monthly}_projections_{abs,anom}.png` | `plots/cmip6_{precip,temp}_{annual,monthly}_{absolute,change}.png` | The old names contradicted their contents — `precipitation_anomaly_projections_abs.png` plots absolute levels, so "anomaly" sat in the filename of the non-anomaly figure. |

The figure scheme is `{clim_project}_{variable}_{view}_{quantity}`, using the same
`precip`/`temp` names as the config and the tables, and the same
`absolute`/`change` distinction the tables draw.

`raw/` is unchanged, and **filenames are identical across both tiers**: the
directory carries the tier, the filename carries the identity. `grids/series/`
also keeps its name — it is the *gridded* counterpart, so `grids/scalar/` would
be a contradiction.

An existing project directory strands its old `series/` folder, since Snakemake
cannot clean a path it no longer declares. `dev/scripts/prune_series_cache.py`
now reports it as a legacy generation; delete it once (see "Post-migration
cleanup" below).

## Rebuilt tables

`summary/cmip6_change_factors_{annual,monthly}.csv` replace the long tables *and*
the three wide `summary/annual_change_scalar_stats_summary{,_mean}.{nc,csv}`
files, which are **no longer written**. Nothing outside the workflow read them.

Twenty columns became fourteen (fifteen for monthly, which adds `month`):

```
model,scenario,member,horizon,variable,statistic,
reference_value,absolute_value,units,relative_value,relative_units,
status,reference_window,horizon_window
```

- **`reference_value`** is the **baseline level** — e.g. `25.057` degC — in `units`.
- **`absolute_value`** is the **future level** — e.g. `26.235` degC — in `units`.
- **`relative_value`** is the change **against the reference window**, in
  `relative_units`: a difference for a variable declared `change: absolute`
  (`+1.179` degC), a percent for one declared `change: relative` (`+10.950`).
- **`reference_window`** and **`horizon_window`** are both the **effective**
  bounds — the complete hydrological years the arithmetic actually used, from
  `hydrological_year_bounds` — in one form:
  `1990-01-01 / 2010-12-01` and `2070-01-01 / 2090-12-01`.

  `horizon_window` previously reported the config's **nominal** year pair
  (`2070-2090`) beside an effective reference span, so two adjacent columns
  disagreed about both meaning and format. The effective horizon bounds were being
  computed all along (`get_change_annual_clim_proj` needs them to aggregate) and
  then discarded. If you parse this column, the value shape changed. The nominal
  horizons are unchanged in `report.md` and `provenance.json`, which is where the
  config echo belongs.

### Number formatting in the CSVs

Every float in every WF2 CSV is written **fixed to 3 decimal places**; integer
columns (`month`, `n_reference_years`) stay integral and text is untouched. This
replaces the full float64 representation, which ran to 17 significant digits
(`9.331056256303583`).

Two things it fixes. Excel prompted *"By default, Excel will perform the
following data conversion"* every time one of these files was opened — the long
floats were the only conversion trigger the files carried. And fixed-point never
emits an exponent, so a near-zero ratio can no longer arrive as `1.2345e-06`, the
form Excel converts most eagerly.

**This does not undo "Rounding dropped (5c)" above.** 5c removed quantisation from
the **stored** monthly series (`scalar/*.nc`), because that fed every downstream
calculation and put a 0.005 mm/day floor under it. This rounds only the
**presentation** CSV, at write time. The netCDFs keep full precision, and nothing
in the workflow reads these CSVs back (`plot_climate_proj_timeseries` declares the
annual table as an ordering edge and never opens it).

3 dp is 100× finer than the default `relative_change.min_reference` of
0.1 mm/day, so it cannot interact with the dry-month threshold. If you declare a
variable whose units make its values small in absolute terms, that is the case to
revisit — `CSV_DECIMALS` in `blueearth_cst/projections/change_factor_table.py` is
the single knob.

**Two corrections you should know about, because they change numbers you may
already have:**

1. The old `units` column was **wrong for every relative variable** — it reported
   the underlying variable's units (`mm/day`) beside a value that was a percent.
2. Model names longer than the first-merged one were **silently truncated** in the
   wide summary — `NOAA-GFDL/GFDL-ESM4` became `NOAA-GFDL/GFD`. The old `dataset`
   column carried the truncated name. Fixed; `model` now reports the full
   `source_id`.

Both levels are shipped so that every number in a row is recoverable from that
row: the change is `absolute_value - reference_value` (or that over
`reference_value`, as a percent). This also keeps the dry-month rule exact — a
flagged month drops the meaningless ratio and still carries the informative
difference.

`composition.csv` drops from 15 columns to 10 on the same principles: `model`
replaces `dataset`/`institution`/`source_id`, and the constant `catalog_crawled_on`
and reference-window columns move to the artifacts that own them.

**Precipitation is now reported in mm/day everywhere, figures included.** The
annual precipitation figure previously plotted mm/year, so it disagreed with every
table by a factor of 365.

## Removed output

`timeseries/gcm_timeseries.nc` is **no longer written**. A project directory from
an earlier run keeps its stale copy — Snakemake cannot clean an output no longer
declared — so delete `climate_projections/<proj>/timeseries/` by hand once; fresh
runs never create it. It merged the nine `scalar/*.nc` into one cube that
nothing consumed, while rounding to 2 decimals — re-imposing the quantisation
"Rounding dropped" above removes — and stripping every `cst_*` attribute, so it
carried no digest, region fingerprint or calendar and could not be traced.

If you were reading it, use `scalar/*.nc` for the full monthly timeseries (same
values, unrounded, with provenance) or the change-factor tables above.

## Fixed: the `units` attribute on the netCDFs

`raw/*.nc` and `scalar/*.nc` used to carry `units = "kg m-2 s-1"` on `precip` and
`"K"` on `temp` while the values were already mm/day and °C — the catalog's
`data_adapter` converts on read and does not rewrite the attribute. Both tiers now
carry the units declared in your `variables:` block. A `raw/` slice cached before
this change is repaired in place the next time the run touches it; no re-download.

## Post-migration cleanup

Snakemake cannot clean an output it no longer declares, so a project directory
from an earlier run keeps every superseded path. Delete these once, per project:

```
climate_projections/<proj>/series/          # renamed to scalar/
climate_projections/<proj>/timeseries/      # removed entirely
climate_projections/<proj>/change_factors/  # moved into summary/
climate_projections/<proj>/provenance.json  # moved into summary/
climate_projections/<proj>/summary/annual_change_scalar_stats_summary*
climate_projections/<proj>/plots/{precipitation,temperature}_*_projections_*.png
climate_projections/<proj>/plots/projected_climate_statistics.png
climate_projections/<proj>/grids/                # if you ever set save_gridded: true
logs/2.0{2,3,4,5}_{monthly_stats_hist,monthly_stats_fut,monthly_change,monthly_change_scalar_merge}.log
logs/2.0{1,2,4,6}_*.log, logs/2.11_extract_climate_grid.log   # see "One log per workflow"
logs/_parts/2.0{2,3,4}_{monthly_stats_hist,monthly_stats_fut,monthly_change}/
```

`dev/scripts/prune_series_cache.py` reports the stale `series/` generation;
the rest are a manual delete. Do this **before** recording any reference
snapshot, or the snapshot bakes in files the workflow no longer produces.

## One log per workflow (all three workflows)

Every workflow used to scatter its run across many log files — WF2 left five in
`logs/`, WF1 thirteen, and WF3 wrote hundreds (3.05/3.07/3.09 log one file per
`(realization, stress-test)` combination and 3.10 one per batch). Following a
single run meant opening all of them and knowing the order to read them in.

Each workflow now writes exactly one log:

| Workflow | Merged log | Gather rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Snakefile_model_creation` | `logs/wf1_model_creation.log` | 1.16 `gather_logs` |
| `Snakefile_climate_projections` | `logs/wf2_climate_projections.log` | 2.07 `gather_logs` |
| `Snakefile_climate_experiment` | `logs/wf3_climate_experiment_<experiment>.log` | 3.18 `gather_logs` |

Every rule logs into `logs/_parts/`, the gather rule merges the parts, then
deletes them and prunes the emptied directories — so after a clean full run there
is no `logs/_parts/` either. Each merged file carries **one** provenance header at
the top (the per-part `# BlueEarth-CST | project: … | log: … | started …` blocks
are stripped), then one section per rule:

```
================================================================================
== 2.01  fetch_gcm_raw
================================================================================

-- cmip6_INM_INM-CM4-8_historical_r1i1p1f1 -------------------------------------
19:39:26 - fetch - INFO - raw cache_hit digest=b352f7bd93d0 (…)
```

Sections are in rule-number order (matching the workflow's `benchmarks/*.md`), and
a fan-out rule gets one `--` sub-header per member — the CMIP6 series above, or
WF3's `rlz_2_cst_1` / `batch_0`. Members sort naturally, so `rlz_2` precedes
`rlz_10`.

Two behaviours to know:

- After a **partial** re-run only the rules that actually re-ran have parts, so
  the rewritten log marks the others
  `# (no part from this run — rule was already up to date)`. The log describes the
  run that produced it, not an accumulated history.
- `extract_climate_grid` is one rule shared by all three workflows (1.10 = 2.11 =
  3.02). Run in order, WF1 builds the shared climate store and the others find it
  current, so that section normally carries the same marker in WF2's and WF3's
  logs — the work is recorded in `wf1_model_creation.log`, not missing.

Snakemake cannot clean logs it no longer declares, so an existing project keeps
the old per-rule files. Delete them once (they are listed under "Post-migration
cleanup" above for WF2; for WF1 and WF3 remove `logs/1.*.log` and
`<exp_dir>/logs/3.*` respectively).

---

## Figures

The anomaly and monthly projection figures no longer show a **multi-model median**
or a **5–95 % envelope**. They show **one labelled trace per (model, scenario,
member)**, because under this design each combination is one data point and
nothing is averaged across them. If you want an ensemble summary, it is a
downstream analysis over `change_factors/*` — deliberately not computed here.

---

## Recommended reference window

`project_config.template.yml` now recommends **1985–2014**: thirty years ending at
the last year the CMIP6 historical experiment covers. The range is inclusive, and
with the default water year starting in January that is thirty complete
hydrological years. Any other start month yields 29, with the partial years at
both ends dropped — every artifact reports the effective window and count beside
the nominal one, so the difference is never silent.

> **Key renamed since this guide was written.** The setting was
> `workflows.climate_projections.start_month_hyd_year`; it moved to
> `shared.water_year_start` on 2026-08-12 and the old spelling is now a
> parse-time error. It was also **inert** until that date — the change-factor
> arithmetic always used January whatever the key said — so for any non-Jan
> project the paragraph above described the intent, not the behaviour.

Test fixtures keep `[1990, 2010]` deliberately, so the recommendation change moves
no test number.
