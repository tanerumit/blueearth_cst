"""Tests for the portable tee wrapper (t260721a).

The contract that matters: the wrapper returns the *child's* exit code (a bare
``| tee`` returns tee's, masking failures on cmd.exe) and mirrors the child's
output into the log file. Child commands are ``python -c`` snippets so the tests
are OS-independent and need no hydromt/julia.
