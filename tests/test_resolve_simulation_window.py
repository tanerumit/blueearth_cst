"""`workflows.build_model.simulation_window` — the model RUN period.

Split from `shared.historical_window` on 2026-08-10. The record a project
extracts for analysis and the period it simulates are different questions.

They are not independent, though — the simulation window must sit INSIDE the
record, because rule 1.10 builds its forcing from the extracted store. The key
shipped unconstrained, correctly at the time: the forcing then came from the
data catalog and the extraction was not in its path at all.

The load-bearing property here is the passthrough. Every config written before
this key existed carries only `historical_window`, so "absent" has to mean
exactly that window — not a default that happens to look like it.
