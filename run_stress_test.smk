# --- log and benchmark layout -------------------------------------------------
# WF3's two RUN RECORDS are PROJECT-scoped, and carry the experiment id in the

#
#   {project_dir}/logs/wf3_run_stress_test_<experiment>.log
#   {project_dir}/benchmarks/wf3_benchmarks_<experiment>.md
#
# So all three workflows' logs sit in one logs/ and all three benchmark tables in
# one benchmarks/, which is what makes a run comparable across workflows without
# walking into experiments/. The experiment subtree keeps only what is genuinely
# experiment-shaped (config/, climate/, hydrology/, results/) and holds no
# logs/ or benchmarks/ directory at all.
#
# The SCRATCH parts stay experiment-scoped, one level down:
#
#   {project_dir}/logs/_parts/<experiment>/<W.NN>_<rule>[/<member>].log
#   {project_dir}/benchmarks/_parts/<experiment>/<W.NN>_<rule>[/<member>].tsv
#
# NOT optional tidiness. Every WF3 part is named by rule number, so two
# experiments sharing one parts dir would collide: a part stranded by experiment
# A's failed run would be merged into experiment B's log and then deleted with
# it. Today that is structurally impossible because the parts live under
# exp_dir; the <experiment> level is what preserves it after the move.
#
# EVERY WF3 rule that logs writes a PART under LOG_PARTS_DIR, and rule 3.18
# merges the parts into ONE merged log, then deletes them and prunes the emptied
# dirs — matching WF1 (1.17) and WF2 (2.09), and the deal the benchmark table
# already had.
#
# LOG_RULES is the merge order: rule LABELS, not part paths. merge_logs lists each
# label's part dir to find its members, which matters most here: 3.12/3.14 fan
# out over RLZ_NUM x ST_NUM and 3.15 over the batch split, so an explicit part
# list would re-derive ST_START, RLZ_NUM and the `_batches` arithmetic in a second
# place that could drift from the rules that own it. Discovery is scoped to these
# labels, so it is not a blind glob: an orphan dir from a renamed rule is not a
# label and is never read.
#
# ORDER IS BY RULE NUMBER, and since [R10-5] that is also dependency order.
# tests/test_log_rules_contract.py asserts it. 3.02 snapshot_config declares no
# `log:`, and neither gather rule does.
#
# TWO INSTANCES OF ONE DEFECT ARE FIXED HERE, both worth knowing because neither
# raised. The region rule was missing from this list, exactly as it was missing
# from WF1's until 2026-08-04: it is splatted into all three workflows from one
# producer contract, but each workflow owns its own `log:` label and its own
# LOG_RULES, so registering it is a per-file obligation the shared definition
# does not carry. And the per-member weathergen-config rule C29 deleted left its
# label behind, which contributes an empty "no part from this run" section
# forever. Both directions are now mechanically checked for all three workflows.
#
# 3.08 is the SHARED store rule (= WF1's 1.04). Run in pipeline order WF1 builds
# the store and WF3 finds it current, so that section usually reads "no part from
# this run". Listed anyway: WF3 standalone does build it, and an unlisted part
# would be neither merged nor cleaned up.
#
# 3.15's label is the SINGULAR `3.15_run_wflow` while its rule identifiers are
# `run_wflow_batch_<b>`, one per batch. Deliberate (P3-3 keys logs by batch id),
# and it survives renumbering — do not "fix" it.
# The run's key folders, stated once -- see the same block in
# build_model.smk. `experiment` is declared alongside `model` and is
# the longer of the two roots under the project, which is why the token reader
# sorts longest-first: a WF3 run writes almost everything below it.

# 3.06  check_model_reference — refuse to simulate against a changed model.
#
# ORDERING IS THE WHOLE GUARD. A check that runs after the work is a post-mortem:
# the forcing would already be downscaled and the members already run, against
# physics the experiment never recorded. So this rule's sentinel is a declared
# input of rule 3.14, the FIRST rule that touches the model, and the brief's
# rollback rule applies if it cannot be made to fire there.
#
# Why the reference does not simply follow the model: rule 3.05 declares its
# model inputs ancient(), so a rebuilt model does NOT re-trigger it. That is
# load-bearing -- if the reference were rewritten whenever the model changed it
# would always match, and this comparison would be decorative.
#
# A NEW sentinel, deliberately: rule 3.01's sentinel paths carry the
# incremental-execution constraint and are approval-gated, so they are untouched.
#
# THE SENTINEL IS temp(), AND THAT IS THE GUARD'S TRIGGER. A persisted sentinel
# satisfies rule 3.14's edge with a STALE VERDICT: the check passed once, the
# file remains, and 3.14 is free to re-simulate against a model that changed
# afterwards. Detection was never the problem -- forced to run against a drifted
# model the rule raises ModelDriftError naming the changed file. Triggering was.
#
# The exposure needs 3.14 to genuinely re-run: a different `-c` (the batch split
# is core-derived, so the partition changes), deleted temp intermediates, a
# retried failure, added realizations. On an untouched tree at the same `-c`
# nothing re-runs at all, so a stale verdict is harmless there -- the hole is
# real but narrower than "every re-run".
#
# Proven end to end at the R9 landing gate: model perturbed, 3.14 forced to
# re-run at the tree's own core count, run stopped at 1 of 34 steps with
# ModelDriftError and no member simulated.
#
# Dropping `ancient()` from `model_toml` does not fix it: the digest covers
# files this rule does not declare (staticmaps, forcing), and enumerating them
# here would duplicate what `model_digest` discovers through the TOML's own
# pointers -- two lists to keep in step, which is the coupling the pointer
# derivation exists to avoid. temp() sidesteps both. The verdict is deleted once
# 3.14 has consumed it, so the NEXT invocation finds it absent and re-evaluates
# against whatever the digest currently covers.

# 3.13 was write_climate_data_catalog, removed 2026-08-18. It built ONE hydromt
# catalog naming every member, and rule 3.14 read a single entry out of it — so
# a file whose N entries differed only in `uri` imposed a fan-in over the whole
# sweep. Three costs, none of them the catalog's purpose: no member could be
# downscaled until EVERY member was perturbed; the perturbed NCs are `temp()`
# and could not be deleted until the catalog had read them all, so all N had to
# coexist; and a straggler held back the rest.
#
# The catalog itself was never redundant — it is how hydromt learns
# `driver.options.preprocess = harmonise_dims` (the R files are written
# longitude/latitude/time) and `metadata.crs = 4326` (the generator's NC carries
# empty global attrs), and hydromt_wflow's setup methods pass no `source_kwargs`,
# so a bare path cannot carry either. It is an implementation detail OF the
# downscale step, not an experiment artifact, so rule 3.14 now writes its own
# one-entry catalog as a `temp()` output. Measured: 12.2 s of the old rule's
# 13.6 s was the hydromt import, which 3.14 has already paid, so per member this

# --- log gather ---------------------------------------------------------------
# 3.18  gather_logs — merge every WF3 log part into ONE workflow log.
#
# Same rule as WF1's 1.17 and WF2's 2.09, against the same script; only the label
# list, the parts dir and the output name differ. `input:` is the final indicator
# set (identical to gather_benchmarks), which is what schedules it LAST: every
# logging rule is upstream of it. The parts stay in `params:` — they are `log:`
# files, and Snakemake does not track those in the DAG, so naming them as `input:`
# would demand them as buildable targets.
#
# This is the workflow where the merge earns most: 3.12/3.14 write one part per
# (rlz, cst) and 3.15 one per batch, so this experiment's part dir holds hundreds
# of files across four subdirectories. The merge DELETES the parts it consumed and
# prunes the emptied dirs — including the `<experiment>/` level itself, since
# that dir is written by this experiment's run alone. After a PARTIAL
# re-run only the re-run rules have parts, so the rewritten log marks the rest
# "no part from this run" — the same trade `merge_benchmarks` makes (R7-9).
