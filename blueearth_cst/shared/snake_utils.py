      than bare because a repo-relative path and a project-relative one would
      otherwise be indistinguishable in the same line.
    * an installed **dependency** — everything up to ``site-packages`` becomes
      ``<site-packages>/``, so hydromt_wflow's own
      ``.../envs/default/Lib/site-packages/hydromt_wflow/data/parameters_data.yml``

    A fourth, remote rather than local: the object-store prefixes in

    Applied first, since a URI shares no structure with the three below it.

    Order matters: the repo contains the pixi env, so ``site-packages`` is
    matched FIRST or a repo-relative rewrite would hide it. A path in none of
    the three (a data catalog under ``C:\\data\\``) is left absolute — its
    location is the information.

    its root, so a token registered in absolute form — which is the only form

    R07 B8. A *suggestion writer*, never a runtime generator: a name derived

    ``experiments/<id>/``, so nothing would ever be up to date, incremental
    reruns would be impossible, ``--dry-run`` would mislead, and the baseline
    gate would have no fixed path. The helper is invoked once, deliberately,
    and the value it writes is then read as an ordinary config key.

    The workflow's unset-key default (``allocate.resolve_default_experiment_name``)
    reaches the same name without a config edit, and avoids the trap by
    **reusing** an existing dated experiment instead of minting today's. This
    command remains the way to pin a deliberate name, choose one with
    ``--name``, or start a fresh experiment beside an existing one.

    ``project_dir``'s basename is **slugified**, because it is not guaranteed
    to satisfy the grammar ``validate_experiment_name`` enforces (repo-7):
    ``examples/Gabon`` was live in six shipped configs, and production
    ``project_dir`` values routinely carry uppercase, hyphens or spaces. The
    slug is lowercased, every character outside ``[a-z0-9]`` becomes ``_``,
    runs of ``_`` collapse, leading non-alphanumerics are stripped, and the
    result is truncated to fit the length limit once the date suffix is added.

    This deliberately differs from ``validate_experiment_name``'s
    never-silently-lowercase stance: that function VALIDATES a value a human
    chose, where a silent case change would be a surprise; this one PROPOSES a
    value from a path the user did not write as a slug. The proposal is passed
    back through ``validate_experiment_name`` before being returned, so the two
    can never disagree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    project_dir : str | Path
        the run's output root; only its basename is used
    today : str
        date stamp to append, ``YYYYMMDD``. Passed in rather than read from the
        clock so the helper stays deterministic and testable.

    can be derived (e.g. a basename with no alphanumerics at all).

    """The window the hydrological model SIMULATES, which is not the record.

    Two different questions were one config key until 2026-08-10:

    * ``climate.window`` — how much climate record to EXTRACT. It
      feeds the climate store, the climate figures, and (through that store)
      weathergenr, whose wavelet decomposition sets ``MIN_HISTORICAL_YEARS``.
      This is analysis input, and it is what a future standalone climate
      workflow would be parameterised on.
    * ``workflows.build_model.simulation_window`` — the period the model is
      RUN over. It sets the forcing hydromt prepares and the ``[time]``
      ``starttime``/``endtime`` in the wflow TOML, which are necessarily the
      same span: forcing outside the run period is built and never read, and a
      run period outside the forcing has nothing to read.

    The simulation window must sit INSIDE the record, and that is a change from
    how this shipped on 2026-08-10. It was written unconstrained, correctly at
    the time: rule 1.10 declared no climate-store input and read its forcing
    from the data catalog, so the two windows were genuinely independent. Rule
    1.10 now builds the forcing FROM the store, to stop re-reading the same
    source twice, and a simulation period outside the extraction therefore has
    no data behind it. Caught here, at parse time, rather than as a truncated or
    empty forcing twenty rules downstream.

    ``MIN_HISTORICAL_YEARS`` is likewise not applied here. It exists for
    weathergenr's record, so a project can now run a short simulation while
    keeping the >=16-year record a stress test needs — which the single-key
    form could not express.

    OPTIONAL, and absent means EXACT passthrough of ``historical_window`` — not
    a default that happens to coincide. Every config written before this key
    existed therefore behaves identically.

    Returns a mapping with ``starttime``/``endtime``; raises ``ValueError``
    naming the offending key if the window is malformed.
    ``shared_source`` and ``model_source`` name the FILES the two values were
    authored in, and appear in the refusal below. Both default to ``None``, so
    the message shape is unchanged when they are absent -- which is what keeps
    this additive for every caller that has only the two mappings.

    They exist because the comparison became genuinely cross-file at R13: the
    simulation window is authored in the build_model settings file and the
    record in the project file. This is the clearest demonstration that the
    shared-seam placement rule is right rather than arbitrary --
    ``historical_window`` is read by three workflows, so it belongs in the
    project file, and a copy planted in a workflow file is refused at parse
    time rather than allowed to become a second record that disagrees.

def spatial_units_rule(project_dir, spatial_config, data_sources) -> SpatialUnitsRule:
    """Build the one producer contract for the shared vector foundation.

    ONE rule definition, declared in all three workflows (``1.01c`` / ``2.03c``
    / ``3.01f``), over the vector half of what rule 1.02 used to do alone.
    Before ADR 0006 §8, WF2 and WF3 could not reach the basin and subbasin
    boundaries without declaring ``prepare_spatial_maps`` — whose real product
    is ``spatial_maps.nc`` — so a projections-only run would have resampled
    ``vito``, ``modis_lai`` and ``soilgrids`` to draw a subbasin outline.

    Seven outputs. Six are the declared vector artifacts; the seventh,
    ``hydrography.nc``, is the SEAM INTERMEDIATE (§8a). The raster half declares
    it as an input because the whole hydrography grid stack used to cross this
    boundary in memory, and recomputing it would make WF1 read the hydrography
    twice with two grids that can drift. It is deliberately absent from
    ``spatial_catalog.yml``.

    **The params are a pure function of ``project`` + ``shared.basin`` (§8b),
    and that is a requirement, not a convenience.** The five projections-only
    configs contain no ``workflows.build_model`` keys at all, so a params
    payload drawn from that section would differ per invoking workflow — the
    input/params asymmetry ``ext1-02`` forbade for the climate store — and
    ``config_path`` itself differs between a full config and a single-workflow
    one, so declaring it as an input would thrash this rule on every WF1/WF2
    alternation. Hence: no ``config_snake`` input, and the deprecated
    ``workflows.build_model.output_locations`` fallback in
    ``resolve_gauge_points_path`` CANNOT feed this rule. Callers must resolve
    ``spatial_config`` with ``parse_spatial_config(basin_cfg)`` — no model
    section. What makes that safe is rule 3.00b, which already guarantees
    ``shared.basin`` agrees across the workflows that share the rule.

    The thematic source names (``lulc``/``lai``/``soil``) are deliberately NOT
    carried: they belong to the raster half, and carrying them would make a
    change to one of them re-run the vector rule in all three workflows.

    Parameters
    ----------

    Pure, and it lives here rather than in ``downscale_climate_forcing.py``
    because that module reads the ``snakemake`` global at import time and so
    cannot be imported by a test. Separating it makes the PER-MEMBER KEYING
    testable without a Wflow run.

    Every member-specific pointer the caller writes -- the output CSV, the

    That is the cheap half of R9 P2's concurrency falsifier. The expensive half

    because two members could be keyed apart here and still collide if wflow
    ignored the pointer.

    ``out_prefix`` is relative, POSIX and trailing-separated: wflow resolves
    output pointers against ``dirname(toml) + dir_output``, and ``dir_output``
    stays ``"."``, so the config/ -> output/ sibling hop rides in the pointers

    clim_source : str

    historical_window : Mapping

    data_sources : str

    hydrography, basin_index : str
        ``shared.basin.hydrography`` / ``shared.basin.basin_index`` — catalog
        ENTRY NAMES for the delineation, not paths. Optional config keys; the

        ``True`` emits **no param at all**, rather than ``enforce_min_years:
        True``. The params dict is a Snakemake rerun trigger, so adding a key to
        the default path would re-extract every store already on disk and break

    12-member grid gets width 2 (``st_01 … st_12``) because ``st_1, st_11,

    Two jobs, and the second is why this is exact-width rather than the laxer

    1. **Bar the reserved baseline.** ``st_0`` (``st_00`` at width 2) is written
       by ``generate_weather_realizations``; rule 3.12 must never become a
       second producer of it, which surfaces as a ``CyclicGraphException``
       (``run_stress_test.smk``, rule 3.12's own comment).
    2. **Reject an UNPADDED name outright.** At width 2, ``st_1`` fails to match
       and Snakemake raises ``MissingRuleException`` rather than routing it.
       A lax pattern would accept both spellings, so a producer that forgot to
       pad would silently agree with the DAG — the same invisible
       producer/declaration disagreement that broke this milestone's first two
       rename attempts.

    **ANCHOR-FREE, and that is not a style choice.** The obvious spelling is a
    negative lookahead, ``(?!0+$)[0-9]{width}``. It is WRONG here: Snakemake
    embeds a wildcard's constraint inside the regex for the WHOLE path, so the
    ``$`` anchors to the end of that path rather than to the end of the
    wildcard. With ``.nc`` always following, ``0+$`` can never match, the
    lookahead always succeeds, and the constraint silently degenerates to
    ``[0-9]{width}`` -- which admits the baseline and makes rule 3.12 a second
    producer of it. Caught by ``test_cross_workflow_inputs`` and
    ``test_guard_invalidation`` as a ``CyclicGraphException``, and NOT by a
    plain ``--dry-run``, because whether the ambiguity surfaces depends on the
    DAG shape: where the baseline is also reachable from its own plural rule,
    Snakemake prefers that one (fewer wildcards) and the degeneracy stays
    hidden.

    So the not-all-zeros condition is spelled positionally instead: the index is
    exactly ``width`` digits, of which the first NON-zero one sits at some
    position ``k``. Alternating over ``k`` covers every value except all-zeros,
    with no anchor and no lookahead.

        width 1 -> [1-9]

#: since -- invisibly, because the test asserted the raw URI was absent from the
#: console, which the abbreviation alone makes true.
#:
#: The tokens are DERIVED from :data:`_REMOTE_PREFIXES` rather than spelled
#: again, so a second store added there cannot reintroduce the same gap. Only
#: those tokens: ``<data>``, ``<repo>`` and the rest are local paths, and

#: Body lines muted on the CONSOLE only -- matched on the message, after

#: ``Parsing data catalog from <path>`` is hydromt announcing a catalog read.
#: It is one line per catalog PER JOB, and a fanned-out rule reads the same two
#: catalogs in every member: nine parallel jobs of rule 3.14 put eighteen
#: identical lines on the console in the same second. Nothing distinguishes
#: them, and nothing can -- the line names the catalog, which is a property of
#: the run, not of the member.
#:
#: Muting is the only lever available, because collapsing is not: each job is a
#: SEPARATE PROCESS with its own tee, so no in-process buffer can see that the
#: line it is about to print was just printed by a sibling. That is also why
#: this differs from ``_CONSOLE_MUTED_PREFIXES``, which mutes Snakemake's own
#: records in the parent.
#:
#: The line SURVIVES IN EVERY LOG PART, which is where a question about what a
#: job read is actually answered, and the run header names the catalogs up
#: front. What the console loses is a fact it was stating up to eighteen times
#: and that nobody reads on the eighteenth.
#:
#: Most of what follows is hydromt's MODEL-OPEN BOILERPLATE, muted for the same reason and
#: on the same terms. Every rule that touches the built model reopens it, and
#: each reopen announces the plugin version, the TOML it read and the Wflow
#: version it supports -- three rows, eight times in one WF1 build and once per
#: member in WF3. All three state a property of the RUN, not of the job, and
#: the run header states two of them already.
#:
#: The two ``skip writing`` rows are the other shape worth muting: a report that
#: NOTHING happened. ``No tables found, skip writing.`` is hydromt confirming an
#: absence on every single write, which is the definition of a row that cannot
#: distinguish one job from another.
#:
#: The ``fetch`` entries at the end are the one group that is OURS rather than a
#: library's, and they are held to a stricter test because of it: a row we chose
#: to emit is muted only where a second statement of the same fact reaches the
#: reader anyway. Each carries its own note below.
#:
#: Nothing here is ever a warning or an error -- see the INFO restriction in
#: :func:`_muted_on_console`, which is what keeps a prefix muted for VOLUME from
#: ever silencing a row someone is scanning for.

    A *pure* trailing run of benign interpreter-shutdown excepthook noise (see

    Snakemake does not auto-redirect ``script:`` output to the rule's ``log:``
    (unlike ``shell:`` rules), so a script wraps its body in this manager and
    passes ``snakemake.log[0]``.

    Contract (R3 design §6):
    - creates ``log_path`` and any missing parent directories;
    - both streams are restored in a ``finally`` — the redirection cannot leak
      past the ``with`` block even if the body raises;
    - the exception is **re-raised** (not swallowed), so the traceback still
      reaches Snakemake and the rule fails loudly rather than leaving an empty
      log that Snakemake would read as a finished product;
    - on failure the formatted **traceback is written into the log part** before
      unwinding. Snakemake prints ``check log file(s) for error details`` and
      nothing more, so a log that stops mid-rule actively misdirects: it sends
      an operator to the one file that cannot explain the failure. A deliberate
      ``SystemExit(0)`` is a success and writes nothing (see ``_is_clean_exit``).

    A silence watchdog (``_Heartbeat``) prints an elapsed-time notice to the
    live console when the rule goes quiet for ``heartbeat_interval`` seconds, so
    a stalled job is visible while it runs. It writes to the console only — the
    log file never receives a heartbeat line. ``CST_HEARTBEAT_SECS`` overrides
    the interval (``0`` disables it).

    Library logging bound to the console before entry (hydromt's ``StreamHandler``
    on ``sys.stdout``) is repointed through the tee for the duration, so its
    records get the same compacted ``HH:MM:SS - <module> - <LEVEL> - <msg>`` form

    * **An unrecognized ``level`` is never suppressed.** A caller passing a
      level this table does not know keeps printing — a filter that silently
      swallowed an unfamiliar level would hide exactly the unusual row worth
      seeing.

    Still ``sys.stdout`` rather than ``logging``, deliberately: the tee captures
    ``sys.stdout``, so a row that went through a logging handler would bypass
    the mechanism that puts it in the rule's log file. The floor therefore
    belongs INSIDE this function, not in a migration to ``logging``.

    **One ``write`` per row, not ``print``.** ``print`` emits the text and the
    newline as two calls, and :func:`_muted_on_console` refuses any chunk that
    is not exactly one newline-terminated line — deliberately, since a tee is
    handed chunks rather than lines. So a row emitted through ``print`` can
    never match ``_TEE_CONSOLE_MUTED``, and until this changed the mute table
    reached hydromt's records (``StreamHandler.emit`` writes ``msg +
    terminator`` in one call) but not a single row of our own. The visible
    output is identical either way; what changes is that our rows are now
    mutable on the same terms as everyone else's. Same defect and same fix as
    ``add_climate_forcing._run_streaming`` in the wf1-wf3 console lean.

    with a hand-written ``WARNING <workflow>:`` prefix, and a ``log_row`` on
    stdout. Four spellings of one thing, none of them the colour the same
    warning gets once a rule is running.

    ``HH:MM:SS - <module> - WARNING - <message>``, where ``module`` names the

    in-run row names ``states`` or ``data_source``. **The colour is not chosen

    ``module`` is a Snakemake KEYWORD, and its parser reads a line opening with

    colon after module keyword``, raised at parse time before any rule exists.
    A single-line call is fine (the token is then mid-expression); a call broken

    ``script:`` rules: every produced map/plot is accounted for in the rule's
    log instead of the log being empty or showing only upstream library
    chatter. Parent directories are created. ``kwargs`` pass through to
    ``Figure.savefig`` (e.g. ``dpi``, ``bbox_inches``). matplotlib is
    imported lazily so this module stays light for the Snakefiles that import it
    only for ``get_config`` / ``stress_test_grid``.

    **One row per DIRECTORY, not per figure.** A single wf0 plotting rule
    writes 33 figures, and a row each made the figures the bulk of the whole
    workflow's console -- 54 of wf0's ~117 rows, all of them the same sentence
    with one word changed. The rows are accumulated by directory and emitted on
    flush::

        21:50:31 - plot - 9 figures -> <climate>/era5_20000101_20161231/plots
        21:50:31 - plot - 24 figures -> <climate>/era5_.../plots/subbasins

    The previous scheme printed the directory once and then indented bare file
    names under it, which halved the width but not the row COUNT, and it broke
    down exactly where it was needed most: these rules alternate between a
    parent directory and its ``subbasins`` child, so "state the directory when
    it changes" restated it on nearly every other row. Accumulating per
    directory rather than tracking only the last one is what makes the
    alternation collapse to two rows instead of twelve.

    Naming the directory rather than dropping the paths entirely is the
    deliberate half: a log is the artifact someone sends you when a run went
    wrong, and a bare count would leave "where did they go" answerable only
    from the Snakefile. A per-file record still exists -- on disk, and in the
    rule's declared outputs.

    Flushing is automatic (:func:`flush_figure_bundles`): any other ``log_row``
    closes the open bundles first, so a module's own summary line still reads
    after the figures it summarizes, and ``tee_to_log`` drains whatever is left
    when the log closes.

    ``fig`` defaults to the current figure, which is what every historical
    caller relies on. Pass it explicitly when one plot writes MORE THAN ONE
    file (a vector deliverable plus a raster preview): two saves that both
    resolve "current figure" through global pyplot state are a silent
    correctness trap the moment any intervening code creates a figure.

#
# * ``_ANSI_RUN`` (blue) -- a job STARTED. The line that says what you are now
#   waiting for, so it is the one the eye goes to.
# * ``_ANSI_DONE`` (green) -- a job FINISHED. Green because that is what green
#   means everywhere else a machine reports on work, and the pair then reads
#   without a legend: blue is in flight, green is behind you.
# * ``_ANSI_BODY`` (light grey) -- everything in between: a rule's own output,
#   the heartbeat's status notices, and Snakemake's informational lines. This is
#   the bulk of the output and it recedes.
#
# Superseded the earlier per-FIELD scheme (bold cyan identity, grey qualifiers)
# on 2026-08-14: within one line the identity did stand out, but across a long
# run every line looked alike, and what a reader scrolls for is "where did this
# job start" / "what finished", not a field.
#
# WARNING and ERROR records are never recoloured, so Snakemake's own red stays
# the loudest thing on screen -- three tiers describe the ROUTINE path only.
#
# The body is a FIXED light grey (256-colour 250) rather than the ``2m`` faint
# it was until 2026-08-14. Faint has one real advantage -- it dims whatever
# colour the terminal already uses, so it cannot land close to the background on
# a light theme -- and one practical cost, which is that on a dark terminal it
# dims far enough to be work to read, which is what a body tier must not be when
# it is most of the output. A fixed grey is the deliberate trade, and it is
# **one constant to swap** if it reads wrong on your terminal: back to ``2``, or
# to ``90`` (bright black) for something between the two.
#
# The other two are the bright 8-colour codes, which follow the terminal's own
# palette rather than pinning an exact hue -- so they stay in whatever key the
# theme is written in. All three are swappable here and nowhere else.
#
# Two more sit OUTSIDE the routine three, for the two lines that report that
# something went wrong or might have. They are deliberately not a fourth and
# fifth tier: the three above classify every routine line, while these mark the
# exceptional one, so they appear at most twice in a run.
#
# * ``_ANSI_FAIL`` (red) -- ``run_summary``'s FAILED verdict, and nothing else.
#   Snakemake's own error block is already red, and the verdict is the line a
#   reader scrolls to the bottom to find; in the routine three it was grey.
#   The SUCCESS verdict stays uncoloured on purpose. Colouring both would make
#   the pair a status field to be read, when the whole value here is that a
#   failed run looks different from every other run without being read.
# * ``_ANSI_WARN`` (yellow) -- the heartbeat's ``still running`` notice and its
#   ``failed after`` verdict. A stall notice is the console saying it does not
#   know whether anything is wrong, which is neither routine nor an error, and
#   is exactly what yellow means everywhere else. Its ``done in`` all-clear
#   stays body-tier: the alarm is the news, the resolution is not.

_ANSI_DONE = "92"  # bright green
_ANSI_BODY = "38;5;250"  # light grey

_ANSI_WARN = "93"  # bright yellow
_ANSI_ALERT = "38;5;208"  # orange
_ANSI_RESET = "\033[0m"


# A sixth colour, and the only one chosen by reading a line rather than by the
# caller that emits it: severity announced by the TEXT.
#
# The five above are assigned at the emit site, because the emitter knows what
# kind of line it is writing. That does not reach the majority of what scrolls
# past here -- rows from our own scripts, and the raw stdout of hydromt, R,
# Julia and wflow -- all of which arrive at the tee as undifferentiated body
# text. A warning from any of them was previously the same light grey as the
# path it printed on the line before, which is the one case where "everything
# routine looks alike" is wrong: the whole point of a warning is that it is not
# routine.
#
# Orange rather than the heartbeat's yellow, deliberately. Yellow already means
# "the console does not know whether anything is wrong" (a stall notice), and it
# appears at most twice in a run; this means "something in the run reported a
# problem", and can appear inline anywhere. Two adjacent meanings that a reader
# must not have to disambiguate by position.
#
# Matching is CASE-SENSITIVE and word-bounded, which is what keeps it from
# firing on ordinary text: `error_metrics.csv`, `n_errors=0` and a rule named
# `compute_errors` are all lowercase and none of them match. The uppercase forms
# are what Python's `logging`, hydromt and Snakemake emit; the mixed-case ones
# are R's (`Warning message:`, `Error in ...`) and Python's warning classes
# (`FutureWarning:`), which are equally load-bearing and equally unmissable.
#
# Failure is tested FIRST so a line carrying both reads as the worse of the two.

    ``code`` overrides the tier for the heartbeat's stall notices, which are

    are not routine. Passing the code rather than adding a second function is
    what keeps the carriage-return and whitespace rules below applying to

    **A line's own severity outranks ``code``.** ``_severity_code`` is consulted
    per line, so a ``WARNING`` or ``ERROR`` arriving as ordinary body text --
    from our scripts, or from hydromt / R / Julia / wflow stdout -- is painted
    for what it says rather than for the tier its emitter assumed. Applied here
    because this is the ONE funnel every console-bound chunk passes through:
    the tee, the heartbeat and the console handler all call it, and none of them
    can see inside the text they forward. Nothing here reaches a log file --
    ``_paint_body`` returns ``text`` unchanged when ``colour`` is false, and the

    **Chunks containing a carriage return pass through untouched.** Those are
    in-place progress bars (dask's ``[####] | 100% Completed``), which redraw
    many times a second: wrapping each redraw would put an SGR pair around every
    frame, and a reset landing mid-bar flickers. They stay uncoloured and stay
    animated, which is the trade the tee already makes for them.

    Whitespace-only chunks are left alone too -- ``print`` commonly arrives as
    two writes, the text then the newline, and colouring a bare newline emits an
    escape pair around nothing.

    Wrapping is per LINE within the chunk, never around the whole of it, so a
    colour never spans a newline. A chunk is frequently ``"...text\\n"`` and can
    hold several lines; wrapping it whole would leave the reset sitting at the

    entry in ``LOG_RULES`` -- and a fan-out rule spells it a fifth time in
    ``name:``. Keeping them in step by hand is how stale and unlisted labels
    kept appearing (`[R10-8]`, and three rules added without their label).

    Built through :class:`RuleRegistry`, never directly: the registry is what
    puts the label in ``LOG_RULES``, and an identity created outside one would
    write parts nothing merges.

    **The number lives in the VALUE, not in the constant's name.** Call the
    constant after the rule (``DELINEATE_REGION``), so a RENUMBER is a one-line
    edit. That is the direction history argues for -- renumbers are the routine
    event here and rule renames are rare -- and naming the constant
    ``RULE_0_02`` would invert it.

    ``part`` is the FAN-OUT argument, and it is a parse-time value, not a
    wildcard. WF0 generates one rule per candidate source in a Python loop, so
    the source is baked into the rule's name and into a per-label directory of
    parts. That is a different mechanism from :func:`rule_banner`'s ``context``,
    which resolves ``{wildcards.*}`` per JOB for a single wildcard rule; pass
    ``context`` through for that case and leave ``part`` unset.

    A conditionally-declared rule needs no special handling and no

    Shows ``<W.NN>  <name>`` (the ``W.NN`` matching the rule's log/benchmark
    filenames) so the live Snakemake console is easy to track.

    **Returns PLAIN TEXT — it never colours.** Colour belongs to whoever writes
    the line, and this string is written to three places with three answers:
    the console (where ``_ConsoleHandler`` paints the whole start line blue),
    ``.snakemake/log/*.snakemake.log`` (a file, which must stay clean), and
    Snakemake's ``JOB_ERROR`` block (where red is the point and our styling
    would fight it). It coloured its own fields until 2026-08-14, which made
    the second of those a file with escape codes in it whenever stderr happened
    to be a terminal.

    ``context`` appends a per-job suffix, and is the answer for FAN-OUT
    rules. This helper is evaluated once at Snakefile parse time, so without it
    every member of a fanned-out rule prints an IDENTICAL banner: on a
    multi-hour WF3 run the console says *something is running*, never *which
    member*. The return value becomes ``message:``, which Snakemake formats per
    job — so a ``context`` holding ``{wildcards.<name>}`` resolves per member
    even though the banner itself was built once.

    Two constraints on what a caller may pass:

    * Only wildcards the rule actually declares. The message is formatted
      against that job's namespace, so a stray field fails at RUN time, not at
      parse time — `tests/test_snake_utils.py` pins the shape, and
      `tests/test_cli.py`'s dry-run is what exercises the real namespaces.
    * **ASCII only.** A Windows console defaults to cp1252 and raises
      ``UnicodeEncodeError`` on the typographic separators that would read
      better here. Use ``|``, not ``·``.

    A rule with no wildcards may still pass a constant context; only the
    *interpolation* needs a wildcard, not the suffix itself.

    The context is BRACKETED (``[rlz 1 | st 2]``). Without ANSI -- a pipe, a
    redirect, CI -- the banner's fields rest on nothing but ``-`` and a double
    space, and the trimming described below removes the ``-`` from most start
    lines, leaving two adjacent runs of text separated by whitespace alone.
    Brackets keep the qualifier separable in every one of the three
    destinations, at the cost of two characters.

    ``summary`` is a plain-language clause saying what the rule DOES, for the
    rules a person waits on: ``1.14  run_wflow`` is an identifier, and someone
    watching a multi-hour run should not have to know the codebase to read the
    console. Applied to the LONG-RUNNING rules only, per the parked note this
    discharges — a sentence on all 47 would lengthen every line to say what the
    fast ones already say by name, and the value is precisely in the rules where
    you are waiting and wondering. It is constant, so unlike ``context`` it must
    not contain a wildcard.

    Being constant is exactly why the CONSOLE prints it once per rule and not
    once per job: the long-running rules are also the FANNED-OUT ones, so a
    summary reprinted per member is the same sentence on every line of the
    longest stretch of a WF3 run — 400 identical clauses on a 10 x 20 grid,
    since rules 3.12 and 3.14 are one job per member. The string returned here
    is unchanged and always carries it; ``_ConsoleHandler._start_line`` does the
    trimming, because the other two destinations want the whole sentence on
    every line. The log file is grepped a line at a time, and a ``JOB_ERROR``
    block is read in isolation from whatever scrolled past hours earlier.

    Order is ``Rule <number>: <name> - <summary>  <context>``: identifier first
    because it is what the log filenames, the benchmark table and this file's
    own rule comments all key on.

    The identifier is SPELLED OUT (``Rule 1.08: build_wflow_model``) rather than
    left as a bare ``1.08  build_wflow_model``. Two digits and a dot are a rule
    number to someone who already knows this console; to everyone else they are
    an unexplained figure sitting where a version or a count could equally well
    be, and the word costs five characters once per line.

    Side effect: records ``name -> number`` in ``_RULE_NUMBERS`` so
    :func:`install_console_style` can put the number on a job's FINISH line,
    which Snakemake reports by rule name only, and ``name -> summary`` in
    ``_RULE_SUMMARIES`` for the once-per-rule trimming above. See those

    Snakemake ends a run with its own one-line verdict and nothing about what
    the run PRODUCED. Two artifacts every run of this toolbox writes are
    consequently invisible unless you already know they exist: the merged log
    (rule W.17/W.18 folds the per-rule parts into one file, then deletes them)
    and the benchmark table (a rule column plus a TOTAL row). This names both.

    Reported as PATHS rather than contents: they are the two things a person
    needs in order to answer "what happened", and printing either inline would
    reproduce on every run the noise these console changes exist to remove.

    ``elapsed_seconds`` is optional because a Snakefile has to measure it
    itself -- Snakemake exposes no run duration to these handlers. It is
    wall-clock from Snakefile PARSE, so it includes DAG construction; that is a
    second or two on these workflows and is not worth a second clock.

    Deliberately absent: a job count. Neither handler is given one, and
    reconstructing it from the DAG would report jobs SCHEDULED rather than jobs
    RUN -- a number that reads as authoritative and is wrong whenever anything
    was already up to date.

    The failure form names the log-parts directory as well, because on failure
    the merged log does not exist yet: rule W.17 is a normal rule and does not
    run when an upstream job fails, so the per-rule parts are still the only
    record. ``show-failed-logs`` (profiles/default/config.yaml) prints the
    failing job's own log inline; this points at everything around it.

    ``log_parts_dir`` is passed rather than derived: WF3 keys its parts by
    experiment (``logs/_parts/<experiment>``), so a derived ``logs/_parts``
    would send the reader to the parent of the directory they want.

    Grouped and labelled like :func:`run_header`, so a run closes in the shape
    it opened in: a head line, a blank, then a labelled group whose rows indent
    one step further. The label is a VERB (``wrote``) because that is what these
    rows are -- artifacts this run produced -- as against the header's ``run``
    (what this run is) and ``path tokens`` (how to read the lines between).

    A FAILED verdict is painted red (``_ANSI_FAIL``), gated on stderr being a
    colour console. The success verdict is not painted at all: what matters is
    that a failed run looks different from every other run WITHOUT being read,
    and colouring both would turn the pair into a field to be read instead.

    (``rule``/``input``/``output``/``jobid``/``resources``) rather than
    reformatting part of it.

    That trade is free for `rule all` specifically, which is why this helper is

    benchmark table and the rule comments key on, so one grep finds a rule's
    whole story. Timestamps are ``HH:MM:SS``, matching :func:`log_row` rather
    than introducing ``time.asctime`` as a second clock format.

    **Only the terminal changes.** Snakemake's own
    ``.snakemake/log/*.snakemake.log`` is written by a separate handler this
    never touches, so the verbose record survives for anyone who wants it.

    **Errors are delegated, never reformatted.** ``JOB_ERROR`` /
    ``GROUP_ERROR`` and every unrecognized record go to Snakemake's own
    formatter, which is what carries the ``show-failed-logs`` inline log dump
    and the input/output/shellcmd block a failure report needs. This class
    reshapes the routine path and stays out of the way on the one that matters.

    Events are compared as PLAIN STRINGS. ``LogEvent`` is a ``StrEnum``, so
    ``record.event == "job_info"`` holds for the member itself -- which keeps
    this class importable, and unit-testable, without snakemake installed.

    **``--quiet`` still means what it means**, because the inherited filter runs
    BEFORE this handler and can remove either half of a pair. ``--quiet rules``
    drops the start records, so a finish falls back to Snakemake's own
    ``Finished jobid: N (Rule: x)`` text plus our stamp and counter -- still one
    line, still naming the rule. ``--quiet progress`` drops the finish records
    entirely, leaving only start lines, which is what asking for no progress
    reporting should give; the start memo is capped so that mode cannot grow a
    dict without bound. Neither combination was hypothetical: both were run.

    **Two GROUPS, blank-line separated, each under a label.** The rows are two
    different kinds of thing and read as one wall of text without the split:
    the first three answer "which run is this", while the ``<name>`` rows are a
    LEGEND -- they define the tokens every path in every line below is printed
    with. Nothing said so, which left a reader to infer from angle brackets
    alone why ``<model>`` was written that way, and the block ran on into
    Snakemake's own ``Job stats:`` with no air between them.

    The labelled rows indent one step further than the label, which is what
    makes the grouping visible without a rule or a box. :func:`run_summary`
    closes the run in the same shape, under one group labelled ``wrote``.

    Every value is FORWARD-SLASHED, including ``config`` -- which was the one
    row that was not, so a block whose whole purpose is to state paths mixed
    ``C:\\a\\b`` with ``a/b`` and read as two trees. ``config`` is also printed
    through the repo strip that every rule log line already uses, so it reads
    ``<repo>/test_case/project_config_rapid.yml`` rather than the same fact
    behind 60 characters of machine-specific prefix.
