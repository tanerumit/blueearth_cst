"""The dry-month rule: near-zero reference denominators (design §5.6, ruling A2).

A relative change is undefined-in-practice when the reference is near zero. The
annual product largely avoids it — a year's total is rarely near zero — but the
**monthly** product added at 6a-ii walks straight into it on any basin with a dry
season, where a 0.2 mm/day reference January turns a trivial absolute change into
a four-figure percentage.

The rule (A2, closing OQ-9):

* flag when ``reference < min_denominator`` — **strictly** below; a reference
  exactly at the threshold is not flagged;
* a flagged month emits ``value = NaN`` and
  ``status = "reference_below_threshold"``, and keeps the **absolute** change in
  ``absolute_value``, because the ratio is meaningless while the difference still
  carries information. Dropping both would be a worse answer than the infinity it
  replaces;
* the default is ``precip: 0.1 mm/day`` (≈3 mm/month) — below which a reference
  month is hydrologically negligible for a stress test that perturbs
  precipitation by *percentage*. Deliberately conservative, and revisable by
  measurement without a design change;
* a ``change: relative`` variable outside the shipped set has **no default**: the
  config must supply a threshold and DAG build raises otherwise. Falling back to
  precipitation's 0.1 would apply a rainfall threshold to an unrelated quantity in
  unrelated units.
