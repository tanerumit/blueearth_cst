# Install weathergenr v1.2.0 from GitHub via remotes::install_github.
#
# Invoked at env-setup time by:
#     pixi run install-rdeps
# (also pulled in transitively by `pixi run install`).
#
# Why remotes and not pak:
#   conda-forge's r-pak is dysfunctional on win-64 — loading it warns
#   "Wrong OS or architecture, pak is probably dysfunctional" and
#   pkg_install() dies with "object 'clic_start_thread' not found". pak
#   bought us nothing here anyway: weathergenr is a pure-R package
#   (no src/, NeedsCompilation: no) and all 16 of its Imports are already
#   present as conda binaries in the pixi env, so there is no binary
#   resolution or compilation to do — remotes just fetches the tarball
#   and copies the R sources into the library.
#
# Where it lands:
#   .libPaths()[1], which under pixi is the env's R site-lib
#   (.pixi/envs/<env>/lib/R/library) on both win-64 and linux-64. There
#   is no separate user-level R lib on the path under `Rscript --vanilla`.
#
# Why dependencies = FALSE / upgrade = "never":
#   every Import is already installed and conda-managed. Installing or
#   upgrading anything from CRAN here would shadow a conda binary with a
#   source build against a different toolchain — the exact ABI mismatch
#   ("Mingw-w64 ... 32 bit pseudo relocation out of range") we want to
#   avoid. So we touch nothing but weathergenr itself.
#
# Idempotent: returns early if weathergenr at the right version is
# already present anywhere visible to R.
