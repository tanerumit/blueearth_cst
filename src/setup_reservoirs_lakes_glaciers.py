"""Update a wflow model with reservoirs, lakes and glaciers.

This runs as a **separate rule** (rather than inside create_model's build
config) because hydromt 1.3's ``hydromt build`` cannot tolerate per-method
no-data for reservoirs/lakes/glaciers — a basin may legitimately lack any of
them. Running each method individually here lets a NoDataException skip only
that one method.

Removal trigger: fold these methods back into create_model's build config and
delete this module once upstream hydromt handles per-method no-data gracefully
during build. (Tracked upstream; no issue number recorded yet.)
