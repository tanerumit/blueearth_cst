"""One table and one figure per variable, COMPARING the candidate climate sources.

Rule ``compare_climate_sources``'s script (``analyze_climate.smk`` 0.06). WF0
already draws the canonical figure set once per candidate source, each in its own
directory, and rule 0.04b pins them to a shared scale so two directories can be
read against each other. This module is the step that stops asking the reader to
do that: every source on ONE axis, plus the summary table that says what each of
them is.

The shape follows the CRIDA Zimbabwe report (``UNESCO_FinalReport_Draft_v4``,
Table 1 / Figures 2-3) — a gridded-dataset summary table, an annual series per
dataset, and a monthly climatology per dataset — narrowed to the datasets a
project actually extracted.

Three boundaries, all deliberate:

* **Figures only for a variable at least two sources carry** (owner ruling
  2026-08-17). A single-carrier variable drawn as a "comparison" is one line and
  a legend, which asserts a comparison that was not made. The TABLE still lists
  every candidate — that is what makes it a summary rather than a second copy of
  the figure's contents.
* **``pet`` is not compared.** It is not in a climate store; it is derived per
  source from that source's orography by the model-parity machinery
  (``plot_climate_source.source_grid_climate``). Comparing it would make this
  rule depend on an orography input per source, and it cannot arise today
  anyway: era5 is the only supported source that is not precipitation-only, so
  ``pet`` can never have two carriers. Extending to it is wiring the orography
  inputs, not a redesign — see :data:`COMPARABLE_VARS`.
* **No shared-scale input.** ``climate_levels.json`` (rule 0.04b) exists so
  SEPARATE per-source figures are comparable. Every figure here already carries
  every source on one axis, so the edge would buy nothing and re-fire this rule
  whenever the scale moved.

Values come from ``climate_figures``' own derivations
(:data:`~blueearth_cst.climate_analysis.climate_figures.VALUE_DERIVATIONS`), on
the same water-year anchor, so "annual precipitation" means here exactly what it
means in each source's own ``era5_precip_annual_ts_basin_avg.png``, over the
same basin cells and the same period. Deriving it
independently is the defect that indirection exists to prevent — the same reason
``climate_levels`` reaches for it.
