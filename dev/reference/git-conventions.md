# Git conventions — branches, tags, and commits

Two things: an inventory of the repo's **durable** refs and what each one is for, then the conventions
that govern new branches, tags, and commit messages. Transient branches don't belong in the inventory.

Branch and worktree *lifecycle* — how a branch is created, claimed, and landed — is owned by the
`git-workflow` skill, not this file.

Verify the inventory against `git tag` and `git branch -a` rather than trusting its age.

## Durable branches

| Branch                           | Role                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `main`                           | Moving trunk and GitHub default. All milestones merge here. The only branch that is pushed routinely. |
| `upstream-deltares`              | Frozen upstream Deltares state at fork-renaming time. **Never commit to it.**              |
| `base/v0.1.0-alpha`              | Frozen historical starting point of the fork.                                              |
| `milestone/01-replication`       | Sealed Phase 1 milestone (kept alive for late patches / PR prep).                          |
| `milestone/02-pixi-installation` | Sealed Phase 1 milestone.                                                                  |
| `milestone/02b-library-upgrades` | Sealed Phase 1 milestone.                                                                  |
| `milestone/02c-tests`            | Sealed Phase 1 milestone (local tip carries a late followups patch).                       |
| `milestone/r01-contracts`        | **Sealed** 2026-07-18 (tag `r01-contracts`) — R1 config-contract migration; merged to `main` 2026-07-18. Kept alive as a durable phase marker. |
| `milestone/r02-naming`           | **Sealed** 2026-07-19 (tag `r02-naming`) — R2 naming style guide; merged to `main` 2026-07-19. Kept alive as a durable phase marker. |
| `milestone/r03-model-builder`    | **Sealed** 2026-07-19 (tag `r03-model-builder`) — R3 workflow-1 cleanup; behavior-preserving (14/14). Merged to `main` 2026-07-19. Kept alive as a durable phase marker. |
| `milestone/r04-projections`      | **Sealed** 2026-07-20 (tag `r04-projections`) — R4 workflow-2 cleanup. Merged to `main`. Kept alive as a durable phase marker. |
| `milestone/r05-experiment`       | **Sealed** 2026-07-20 (tag `r05-experiment`) — R5 workflow-3 + weathergen cleanup. Merged to `main`. Kept alive as a durable phase marker. |
| `milestone/r06-refactor`         | **Sealed** 2026-07-23 (tag `r06-refactor`) — R6 structural refactor; behavior-preserving. Merged to `main`. Kept alive as a durable phase marker. |
| `milestone/p31-experiments`      | **Sealed** 2026-07-24 (tag `p31-experiments`) — P3-1 project/experiment structure. Merged to `main`. Kept alive as a durable phase marker. |
| `milestone/p32a-climate-analysis` | **Sealed** 2026-07-24 (tag `p32a-climate-analysis`) — P3-2a model-independent climate analysis. Merged to `main`. Kept alive as a durable phase marker. |
| `milestone/p32b-interchange-contracts` | **Sealed** 2026-07-24 (tag `p32b-interchange-contracts`) — P3-2b model-swap interchange contracts. Merged to `main`. Kept alive as a durable phase marker. |
| `milestone/p33-performance`      | **Sealed** 2026-07-25 (tag `p33-performance`) — P3-3 performance passes. Merged to `main`. Kept alive as a durable phase marker. |
| `milestone/r07-layout`           | **Sealed** 2026-07-29 (tag `r07-layout`) — R7 project layout; behaviour-preserving. Merged to `main`. Kept alive as a durable phase marker. |
| `milestone/r08-wf2-projections`  | **Sealed** 2026-07-31 (tag `r08-wf2-projections`) — R8 WF2 v2.0 GCM projections analysis. Merged to `main`. Kept alive as a durable phase marker. |
| `milestone/r09-project-tree`     | **Sealed** 2026-08-07 (tag `r09-project-tree`) — R9 project-tree migration; all five phases, landing gate nine of nine. Merged to `main`. Kept alive as a durable phase marker. |
| `milestone/r10-rule-naming`      | **Sealed** 2026-08-07 (tag `r10-rule-naming`) — R10 rule identifiers. Cut **retroactively** at `7164d83`, R10's completion point: the work ran on `fix/r09-followups` because it began as R9 followups and grew into the milestone, so this branch records where R10 finished rather than how it got there. Kept alive as a durable phase marker. |
| `milestone/r11-wf3-artifacts`    | **Sealed** 2026-08-08 (tag `r11-wf3-artifacts`) — R11 WF3 result tables and run identification. Cut at `94c5bea`, main's tip: P1 and P2 landed through task branches and P3 ran in the primary checkout (the run and the single baseline re-record require it), so like `r10` this branch records where the milestone finished rather than how it got there. Kept alive as a durable phase marker. |
| `docs/wf3-redesign`              | **Frozen input, do not merge** (tag `archive/wf3-experiment-v2`). The `wf3-experiment-v2` design run (2026-08-01→04), 14,855 lines under `dev/working/design-runs/`. G2 ratified 2026-08-08 as an *architectural input, not an implementable spec* — the tree it was designed against no longer exists. Durable record: `dev/records/milestones/r12/wf3-experiment-v2-design-review-record.md`. Cite the **tag**, not the branch: until 2026-08-19 this commit was reachable only from a branch that exists on no remote, so the citable home of a 14,855-line record was one `git branch -D` from gone. The branch is kept alive as a phase marker, exactly as the sealed milestones above are. |
| `origin/fao` (remote-only)       | Inherited upstream project branch (FAO / DCRM work, ~32 commits off-trunk). Not tracked locally; review before ever deleting. |

## Tags

Tags are permanent rollback points; they never move.

| Tag               | Date       | Meaning                                                                          |
| ----------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `v0.1.0-alpha`    | 2024-09-26 | Upstream release state at the fork point (same commit as `base/v0.1.0-alpha`).    |
| `m01-replication` | 2026-05-07 | Phase 1 seal: replication baseline + fingerprint manifest.                        |
| `m02-pixi`        | 2026-05-07 | Phase 1 seal: pixi env + install.                                                 |
| `m02b-upgrades`   | 2026-05-08 | Phase 1 seal: hydromt/wflow/Python-stack library upgrades.                        |
| `v0.2.0-alpha`    | 2026-05-09 | Release: foundation phase sealed, Phase 2 designed.                               |
| `m02c-tests`      | 2026-07-17 | Phase 1 seal: unit-test coverage for 4 `src/` modules.                            |
| `pre-r01`         | 2026-07-18 | Checkpoint before R1: last flat-config-schema commit; green suite (47/3/2); all three workflow smoke tests verified. |
| `r01-contracts`   | 2026-07-18 | Phase 2 seal: sectioned config schema (project/shared/workflows); suite 51/3/2. Sealed on invariance-by-construction — M2b baseline left untouched (stale; see `dev/records/milestones/r01/baseline_diffs.md`). |
| `r02-naming`      | 2026-07-19 | Phase 2 seal: naming style guide (`dev/reference/naming.md`). Docs-only; existing names grandfathered; suite 51/3/2. |
| `r03-model-builder` | 2026-07-19 | Phase 2 seal: workflow-1 (model builder) cleanup — shared `snake_utils` (`get_config`/`tee_to_log`), per-rule log/benchmark, `outlet_index.csv`, gauges hardening, structured waterbodies sentinel. Behavior-preserving (14/14); suite 73/3/2. |
| `r04-projections` | 2026-07-20 | Phase 2 seal: workflow-2 (climate projections) cleanup, inheriting the R3 patterns. Contract doc `dev/reference/workflows/climate_projections.md`; 11 commits. |
| `r05-experiment`  | 2026-07-20 | Phase 2 seal: workflow-3 (climate experiment) + the R weathergen layer cleaned up, inheriting the R3/R4 patterns. Contract doc `dev/reference/workflows/climate_experiment.md`; 12 commits. |
| `r06-refactor`    | 2026-07-23 | Phase 2 seal: structural refactor — `src/` → `blueearth_cst/` package, `config/` three-bin split, runners → `scripts/`, `enabled:`-aware wrapper, `MIGRATION.md` (51 renames). Behavior-preserving (run-relative baseline + full-tree semantic diff clean). |
| `p31-experiments` | 2026-07-24 | Phase 3 seal: project/experiment structure. |
| `p32a-climate-analysis` | 2026-07-24 | Phase 3 seal: model-independent climate analysis. |
| `p32b-interchange-contracts` | 2026-07-24 | Phase 3 seal: model-swap interchange contracts. |
| `p33-performance` | 2026-07-25 | Phase 3 seal: performance passes; user-signed milestone gate. |
| `r07-layout`      | 2026-07-29 | Phase 4 seal: project layout — single climate store with a model-free shared producer, engine subtrees under `project_dir`, config split four ways, project-level `plots/` and `data/` retired. Behaviour-preserving (full-tree semantic diff clean, discharge bit-identical). |
| `r08-wf2-projections` | 2026-07-31 | Phase 5 seal: WF2 v2.0 GCM projections analysis; all seven §8 migration steps implemented. User migration note in `dev/records/milestones/r08/migration-wf2.md`. |
| `r09-project-tree` | 2026-08-07 | Phase 6 seal: generated project tree — six semantic roots, fan-out members keyed by filename, result tables renamed, pointer-derived model fingerprint with a drift guard, experiment freezing. Landing gate nine of nine; closing record `dev/records/milestones/r09/closing-record.md`. Work completed 2026-08-05; sealed two days later, which is why the seal is now a named step in the roadmap's cross-cutting principles. |
| `r10-rule-naming` | 2026-08-07 | Phase 7 seal: rule identifiers on one `<verb>_<noun>` scheme — twelve renames, `W.NN` renumbered to follow the DAG, `LOG_RULES` made a conformance test, and ADR 0003 §8–12's spatial-units split. Gates: suite 1526 from the primary, a full three-workflow run, `check_baseline` 8/8 after it, `tree-check` 186/0. Script modules deliberately not renamed. |
| `r11-wf3-artifacts` | 2026-08-08 | Phase 8 seal (R11 of R11–R12): WF3 result tables wide→long with one table per output variable, `cst_`→`st_` member identification with zero-padded ids, the stress-test design table and `st_id`, and `aggregate_rlz` retired as a hard error. Gates: suite 1707 from the primary, a full three-workflow run, exactly one baseline re-record with `check` green after it, `tree-check` 221/0. **The run found three defects nothing else could** — two metrics silently absent, a design table recording perturbations never applied, and a test that had asserted nothing since R9; see `dev/records/milestones/r11/phase-3-run-report.md`. |
| `archive/outputs-figures` | 2026-07-26 | Archive of `feat/outputs-figures` before deletion. Superseded by `refactor/plot-map-params` for the `plot_map.py` redesign: both were cut from `75eb4d6` and rewrote the same module independently, so they are alternatives, not composable. Preserved rather than merged because it also carries a `dev/baseline/manifest.json` predating the `ea5ac59` re-record, and merging would silently revert the baseline. |
| `archive/wf3-experiment-v2` | 2026-08-19 | The `wf3-experiment-v2` design run (2026-08-01→04), 14,855 lines of scratch at `531bcc6`, also the head of `docs/wf3-redesign`. G2 ratified it as an **architectural input, not an implementable spec**; R12's stress-test-lookup is what was built. Cut retroactively because the commit was reachable only from a branch that exists on no remote, while ten documents cited it — the citable home of a 14,855-line record was one `git branch -D` from gone. Durable record: `dev/records/milestones/r12/wf3-experiment-v2-design-review-record.md`. |
| `archive/wf3-stress-test-lookup` | 2026-08-19 | The `wf3-stress-test-lookup` design run (2026-08-15), 11,332 lines of scratch at `741e24d` — `design-v1..v4.md`, the three internal-review lenses, two external rounds, `ledger.md`, `review-brief.md`, `observations.md` and `status.md`. Accepted at G2; the durable outputs are `dev/records/milestones/r12/stress-test-lookup-{design,intake,review-record,task-brief}.md`, and the scratch is drained in this tag's child commit. Cut for the same reason as `archive/wf3-experiment-v2` above: a design run's per-round history should be citable by NAME, not by a sha someone has to dig for. |

`r05-experiment`, `p31-experiments`, `p32a-climate-analysis`, and
`p32b-interchange-contracts` are **lightweight** tags; every other tag above is
annotated and carries a message.

## Using a checkpoint tag (e.g. `pre-r01`)

```bash
git diff pre-r01 -- <path>            # what changed since the checkpoint
git checkout pre-r01 -- <path>        # restore one file from the checkpoint
git reset --hard pre-r01              # throw away all commits on the current
                                      # branch since the checkpoint (destructive)
```

Tags protect committed state only — not the working tree, and not run outputs
under `project_dir` (the baseline manifest covers those).

## Maintenance

Update this file whenever a durable branch or tag is created, sealed, or retired. Local tags/branches reach `origin` only on explicit push
(`git push origin <tag>` / `--tags`).

---
## Branching and tagging conventions

**Branches are `<type>/<slug>`** — the Conventional Commits type, then a short kebab-case description
of the work: `fix/fixture-digest-drift-attribution`, `docs/config-modularization`,
`refactor/wf0-rule-label-constants`. No milestone number in the name; the branch is short-lived and its
milestone, if any, is recorded on the board item and in the commit.

Historical patterns preserved on existing refs, not used for new work:

| Pattern | Was |
|---|---|
| `base/<start-point>` | Frozen historical starting point of the fork |
| `milestone/<NN>-<topic>`, `milestone/r<NN>-<topic>`, `milestone/p3<N><letter?>-<topic>` | Sealed phase markers, one per milestone |
| `lane/<territory>` | The two standing territory lanes, retired in favour of allocator-managed session slots |

**Creating and landing a branch is the `git-workflow` skill's contract**, not this file's: a task claims
a session slot, works on its own branch, and the integrator lands it. Do not cut a branch by hand in the
primary checkout.

**Tags.** Phase 1 tags use `m##-<topic>`; Phase 2 onward `r##-<topic>`; Phase 3 sub-milestones
`p3#-<topic>`; archived design runs and deleted branches `archive/<topic>`. The § Tags table above is
the single list — do not restate it elsewhere, because a second copy is what went stale last time. Tags
are permanent rollback points and never move. A milestone branch stays alive after its tag.

Not every piece of work takes a tag or a milestone branch. Both are for a deliberate seal; ordinary work
lands on `main` and is found through `dev/LOG.md`.

**Remotes.**

- `origin` — the fork (`github.com/tanerumit/blueearth_cst`), where CI runs.
- `upstream` — the original Deltares repo (`github.com/Deltares/blueearth_cst`), fetch-only.

`gh` resolves to `upstream` until told otherwise — see `dev/reference/validation-ladder.md`.

The branch `upstream-deltares` freezes the upstream Deltares state the fork tracked at renaming time;
never commit to it. `main` is the moving trunk and the GitHub default.

**PRs back to upstream** go from a dedicated branch, not from `main`. One PR per milestone is the
default; only stack PRs when maintainers explicitly agree to review them in series.

---

## Sealing a milestone

Alongside merging, tagging, and updating the two tables above:

- [ ] **Ask which reference documents this milestone superseded**, and seal
      each one: a `> **SUPERSEDED — … (sealed YYYY-MM-DD).**` banner at its
      head naming what replaced it and where current truth lives, plus an
      entry in `dev/reference/sealed-records.yml`.

Seal them; do **not** migrate their paths. A superseded document is kept
because it is the baseline that milestone's commits were checked against, and
freshening its paths leaves its line numbers, rule names and module locations
lying just as loudly while making the document *look* maintained — strictly
worse than leaving it obviously old.

This step is a judgment and cannot be automated: nothing can infer from a
document's content that it is a record. `tests/test_sealed_records.py` enforces
only what the registry already lists — that each entry keeps its banner and
still hashes to what was sealed. Skipping the question is how
`run_stress_test.md` spent four milestones reading as a live WF3 contract
(R9 P5 F2).

---

## Commit strategy

Branch and tag naming live in § Branching and tagging conventions above. This section is commit messages
only.

**Subject format — Conventional Commits.** `<type>(<scope>): <imperative subject>`, subject ≤72 chars,
no trailing period. Append `!` before the colon for a breaking change (`refactor(workflows)!:`).

| Type | For |
|---|---|
| `feat` | new capability |
| `fix` | a defect corrected |
| `docs` | documentation, including `dev/` records and the board |
| `refactor` | behaviour-preserving restructuring |
| `test` | tests only |
| `chore` | housekeeping — env, ignore rules, tooling |
| `perf` | a measured performance change |
| `style` | formatting only, no code change |

The scope is the area touched, lowercase: a workflow (`wf0`, `wf2`, `wf3`), a subsystem (`console`,
`stage`, `climate`, `plotting`, `runner`), or a documentation surface (`board`, `dev`, `ref`, `agents`,
`tests`). Omit it when the change is genuinely repo-wide.

Examples, all from this repo's history:

- `fix(wf2): refuse to attribute drift against a mismatched fixture`
- `refactor(tests): read LOG_RULES from the parsed workflow, and retire the second parser`
- `docs(ref): state the rules in naming.md, drop the archaeology`
- `chore(board): close t2608201134, and record the ruling`
- `refactor(workflows)!: rename the workflows.<name> config keys and every derived path`

**Body.** Optional. Include only when the *why* is not obvious from the diff. Do not restate what the
diff shows.

**Granularity.** One logical change per commit. If the subject needs the word "and" to join two
unrelated changes, split it.

**Scope every commit by explicit pathspec** to the files the task authored. A bare `git commit -a`
sweeps whatever else is dirty in the checkout, which is how another session's half-finished work lands
in an unrelated commit.

**Never commit.**

- Outputs under `project_dir/`.
- Files matching `*_local.yml` or other local-only configs.
- Secrets, credentials, large binary fixtures.
- Generated baselines other than `dev/baseline/manifest.json` itself.
- Hand-edited `pixi.lock` or `Manifest.toml`.

If any of these slip in, update `.gitignore` first, then remove from history if the commit has not been
pushed.

**Merges and tags.** Default merge-commit messages are fine — do not hand-craft them. A tag message
restates the milestone goal in one line.
