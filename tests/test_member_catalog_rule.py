"""WF3's climate catalog is per member, and nothing fans in over the sweep.

Rule 3.13 ``write_climate_data_catalog`` built ONE hydromt catalog naming every
member, and rule 3.14 read a single entry out of it. The entries differed only
in ``uri``, and the shape cost three things that had nothing to do with what a
catalog is for:

* **a fan-in barrier** — 3.13 declared every member's perturbed NC, so no member
  could be downscaled until every member had been perturbed;
* **peak transient disk** — those NCs are ``temp()``, and Snakemake cannot
  delete one until its last consumer is done, so all N had to coexist;
* **a straggler coupling** — one slow member held back the rest.

Rule 3.14 now writes its own one-entry catalog as a ``temp()`` output beside the
member's TOML. These tests pin that the barrier is gone and cannot come back by
someone re-adding an ``expand`` to 3.14's inputs; the CONTENT of the entry is
pinned in ``tests/test_prepare_climate_data_catalog.py``.

The catalog is still a catalog, not a path handed to hydromt: hydromt_wflow's
``setup_precip_forcing`` / ``setup_temp_pet_forcing`` forward to
``get_rasterdataset`` with no ``source_kwargs``, so a bare path resolves through
the fallback driver and silently loses ``preprocess=harmonise_dims`` and
``crs=4326``.
