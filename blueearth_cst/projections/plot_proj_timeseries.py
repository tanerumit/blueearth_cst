"""Rule 2.07 — the WF2 annual overviews and the per-horizon monthly figures.

Reads the durable `scalar/*.nc` series and the authoritative monthly
change-factor table, and draws the figure set declared by
`projections/projection_figures.py` through the drawing functions in
`projections/projection_plots.py`.

**Two sources, and the split is the whole point of this module's design.** The
monthly change factors are READ from `{clim_project}_change_factors_monthly.csv`
rather than recomputed; the annual overviews are computed from the series,
because they are per-YEAR traces and no table carries a time series. What this
module used to do instead, and why that was wrong, is in the header comment over
the figure-input functions below.

Superseded on 2026-08-17 (owner ruling, board item `t2608091006`): the eight
independently styled figures this drew — `{proj}_{variable}_{view}_{quantity}.png`
— became two annual overviews plus one monthly figure per configured horizon,
on the shared WF1 page contract. The change-factor cloud is drawn by rule 2.06,
from the stage-B merge, and is not duplicated here.

# THE FIGURE INPUTS
#
# Two sources, and the split is the point.
#
# * The MONTHLY change factors are READ from
#   `{clim_project}_change_factors_monthly.csv`, never recomputed here. That
#   table is the authoritative product of `get_change_climate_proj.py`, and it
#   is what WF3 and every downstream reader consume. A figure that recomputed
#   the same quantity would be a second definition of it, free to disagree --
#   and it did: the shipped figures differenced a future month against the
#   historical ANNUAL mean, over the full 2015-2100 series rather than the
#   horizon, so the picture and the table described different quantities under
#   one name. Reading the table makes that class of disagreement structurally
#   impossible rather than merely fixed.
#
# * The ANNUAL OVERVIEWS are computed from `scalar/*.nc`, because they are
#   per-YEAR traces and no table carries a time series. The only arithmetic
#   here is the anomaly against the reference window, and it is differenced
#   against each model's OWN historical run so a future trace is continuous
#   with the historical one it follows.
