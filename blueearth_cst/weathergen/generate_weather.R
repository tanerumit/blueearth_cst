# mask, no weights). The store is a bbox read plus a buffer, so those cells
# include neighbouring climate the basin never sees. On gabon_1008 the basin
# spans 0.80 x 0.53 ERA5 cells and touches 2 of the store's cells, so most of
# the signal steering that stress test came from outside the basin.
#
# The mask is a FILTER, not a weighting (owner ruling 2026-08-10): a cell either
# touches the basin or it does not, and the ones that do count equally. That is
# exactly what weathergenr's own unweighted mean computes -- once it is given
# the right subset -- so nothing upstream needs changing, which matters because
# weathergenr is a vendored package we do not patch.

# Coordinates are matched, never indices: both sides enumerate the grid their
# own way and an index convention would break silently.

# no translation table, which is what the 1.2.0 rename bought.

# instead of forwarded as an explicit NULL that overwrote the receiving
# function's default. It also forwards `relax_order` -- 1.2.0's one unforwarded
# argument, spelled `relax_priority` then -- so the key is back in the config
# and pinned in the contract (t2608121742).

# old `evaluate.model` reached NOTHING -- plot emission is `save_plots`, which
