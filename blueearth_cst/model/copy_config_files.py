_RUNS_README = """\
# What is in this directory

Everything here is **written by the run**. Editing any of it changes nothing:
the next execution overwrites it.

To change what a run does, edit the **source config** you pass to
`--configfile`, then run the workflow again.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `snake_config_<workflow>.yml` | that workflow's composed configuration -- see below |
| `<workflow>/run_record.yml` | what the run resolved to: toolbox commit, environment hashes, the settings actually consumed, and the external inputs referenced |
| `journal.jsonl` | append-only ledger, two lines per run (start and outcome) |
| `invocations/` | one manifest per `scripts/run_workflows.py` invocation |

## What the four `snake_config_<workflow>.yml` files hold

Each is that workflow's **composed** configuration: the project file you passed
to `--configfile`, with the per-workflow settings files it loaded merged back
in. So each one is the workflow-scoped view its name promises, and the four
differ from each other by construction -- a WF1 snapshot does not carry WF3's
stress-test grid.

They differ from your source files in two ways, both deliberate. Comments are
not carried: this is a record, and your files stay the annotated ones. And keys
are sorted, so two runs of the same configuration produce the same bytes.

They diverge across workflows when one workflow has run since the config changed
and another has not, and that divergence is exactly what WF3's consistency guard
reads to refuse an experiment whose model was built under different settings.

Your per-workflow config files are **recorded but not archived**: each appears in
`run_record.yml`'s `referenced_inputs` with its `sha256`, and with
`archived_path: null`, because its content is already inlined verbatim in the
composed snapshot beside it.

## Reading `run_record.yml`

It is **current-only** -- it describes the most recent run of that workflow and
is replaced, not accumulated. `journal.jsonl` is the history.

Two digests, answering different questions:

- `effective_config_sha256` -- the settings the workflow was asked to run under.
- `configuration_inputs_sha256` -- those settings **plus** the toolbox commit,
  the lock files, and the bytes of every referenced catalog and template.

Compare runs with the **wide** one: the narrow one does not move when the code
or a referenced file changes. Neither covers scientific data identity, because
a remote or mutable dataset can change under an unchanged catalog entry.

Two records assert the same CODE only when both have a non-null `commit` and
`dirty: false`. With `dirty: true`, the commit does not fully identify what ran.

## Reading `journal.jsonl`

It records **executed** runs. An invocation that finds everything up to date
does no work and appends nothing, so the line count is an exact count of
executions and a lower bound on invocations -- a gap in the dates means no work
was done in that period, not that nobody ran the command.

## Why some referenced files are here and others are not

A catalog or template is copied into the project only when the toolbox
repository cannot give it back; one that is tracked and unmodified in the
checkout is recorded by its git blob id instead. `run_record.yml` lists every
reference either way, so nothing goes unrecorded.

The **basin data inputs are an exception and are always copied**, into
`config/basin_data/`. They are this project's record of what the model was
built and evaluated against, and a finished project should be able to state
that without the toolbox checkout beside it -- so for them "can the toolbox
give it back?" is the wrong question. Their entries carry `archived_path` AND, when the file
was also tracked, `recoverable: true` and a `git_blob`.

    Snapshot the snake config and its referenced config files into project_dir.

    R07 B9 changed this from "one derived output directory" to explicit
    per-file routing, because the project config snapshot is now split by
    KIND -- runs/, catalogs/, templates/, generated/. That is a signature
    change, not a rename: one output_dir cannot serve four destinations.

    A referenced file is copied only when the toolbox repository cannot give it
    back (see :func:`_tracked_blob`) — except for the roles in
    :data:`ALWAYS_ARCHIVED_ROLES`, which are archived either way. Whether a file
    is copied is therefore a property of the FILE and its ROLE, never of the bin
    it lands in: ``data_sources``, ``model_build_config`` and
    ``waterbodies_config`` hold arbitrary paths, so a project may name a
    site-specific catalog that lives nowhere in the toolbox, and a bin-level
    rule would discard exactly the file the policy exists to protect.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config : Union[str, Path]
        path to the SOURCE project config. Stays the source path even when
        ``composed_config`` is given: ``source_config.{path, sha256}`` must
        keep hashing the file the user invoked, and the run header and error
        messages must keep naming it.
    config_out_path : Union[str, Path]
        FULL destination path for the snake config snapshot (the rule declares
        it, so the bin choice lives in the Snakefile rather than here)
    composed_config : Mapping, optional
        the workflow's COMPOSED config -- the project file plus the
        per-workflow files this entry point loaded, merged. When given, the
        snapshot is a `safe_dump` of this mapping rather than a byte copy of
        ``config`` (R13 D-11.1).

        The copy has to stop being verbatim: after the split the source file
        is the project file, which does not contain the workflow settings,
        and WF3's drift guard reads ``workflows.build_model`` out of the wf1
        snapshot. A verbatim copy would leave the guard comparing against
        sections that are not there.

        ``None`` keeps the byte copy, for callers with no composed document.
    other_config_files : Mapping[src, dest_dir], optional
        each referenced config file mapped to the directory its kind belongs
        in. Missing files are recorded as logical identifiers rather than
        copied -- hydromt's predefined catalogs have no path on disk.
    reference_roles : Mapping[src, role], optional
        the ROLE a referenced file plays, which becomes its destination name
        when it is copied. A file with no declared role keeps its own
        basename. Roles exist because two configured paths can share a
        basename, and the old ``dest_dir / source_path.name`` silently
        overwrote one with the other.
    run_record_path : path-like, optional
        FULL destination path for ``run_record.yml``. When supplied,
        ``effective_config``, ``advanced_settings`` and ``workflow_name`` are
        required.
    effective_config : Mapping, optional
        Snakemake's merged config dictionary, after command-line overrides.
    advanced_settings : Mapping, optional
        Resolved toolbox-wide settings applied outside the project config.
    workflow_name : str, optional
        Workflow the record describes.
    projection : Sequence[str], optional
        the workflow's declared consumed-key paths. ``None`` records the whole
        config, which is over-inclusive rather than wrong.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        if two referenced files resolve to the same destination path. Raising
        is the point: the previous behaviour overwrote one with the other and
        left a project claiming to hold an input it had actually lost.
