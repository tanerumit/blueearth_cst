"""Source resolution for WF2 v2.0 (design §5.7, D6, D7, D12).

Answers, at DAG-build time and without touching the network, "which requested
(model, scenario, member) combinations can actually be reduced?" — so unresolved
combinations never become jobs. That deletes the pattern this workflow used
before: a job that produced a dummy empty netCDF so Snakemake saw its target,
which downstream code then had to filter out (``filter_nonempty`` and three
separate "did this file have data?" loops).

The check is a two-level lookup against the **generated** catalog:

1. does the entry ``{clim_project}_{model}_{experiment}_{{member}}`` exist?
2. is the requested member in that entry's ``placeholders.member`` list?

Both are plain YAML reads. The generated catalog makes this *stronger* than a
hand-curated one, not merely cheaper: its header states that a source name
resolving means the store is really there, because membership is a live-crawl
fact rather than a curated claim.

**Absence and failure are different classes** (design §4 criterion 7). Almost
everything here is a *normal skip* recorded in the composition record — under
ruling R3′ a model that publishes no ssp370, or one member where another
publishes three, is the expected shape of a correct run. Only two conditions are
configuration errors that stop the DAG build: a model absent from the catalog
entirely, and a run where nothing resolves at all.

    one. That is the point: the skips are what make the composition record
    auditable, and an enumerated skip is what replaces the run-time
    ``asymmetric hist/clim members`` raise (design D7).

    ``members`` is an ORDERED PREFERENCE, most-wanted first, and ``selection``
    says what to do with it:

    * ``first_available`` (default) — at most ONE member per model, the first
      that resolves for every requested scenario. Every other member that would
      have resolved is recorded as :data:`MEMBER_SUPERSEDED` rather than
      dropped, so the report still says why it was not used.
    * ``all`` — every member that resolves, which is a deliberate multi-member
      ensemble.

    **This supersedes ruling R3′**, which said ``members`` is a requested SET
    and the run's data-point set is the union of the per-combination
    resolutions. Union-of-resolutions is now ``selection="all"``, and it is no
    longer the default. The reason is not tidiness: a config asking for both
    ``r1i1p1f1`` and ``r1i1p1f2`` — the only way to reach the eight models that
    publish solely at ``f2`` — makes CAMS-CSM1-0, EC-Earth3 and NorESM2-LM
    resolve TWICE, and ``get_change_climate_proj_summary.py`` merges across
    models and reduces with ``stats="mean"``. Those three would be weighted
    double in the multi-model ensemble: a silently wrong number.

    ``overrides`` maps a model to its own preference list, REPLACING the global
    one for that model rather than prepending to it. An override is an assertion
    about a specific realisation, so a silent fall-back to the global list would
    defeat the point of writing it; this function records the failure like any
    other and :func:`unresolved_overrides` is what a caller raises on.

    A single-element ``members`` list resolves identically under both policies,
    and every tracked config today is single-element — which is why the default
    can change at all without invalidating a cached slice.
