"""Tidy change-factor tables (design §5.9, step 6a; reshaped at S8-04).

The summary CSV stage B produced until 6a was *wide*: one row per
`(stats, clim_project, model, scenario, horizon, member)` with each variable as a
**column**. §5.9 replaced it with long format — one row per
`(model, scenario, member, horizon, [month,] variable, statistic)`.

S8-04 rebuilt the column set. Three things were wrong with the first cut:

* **`units` was wrong for every relative variable.** It was populated from the
  variable spec's declared units — the units of the *underlying variable* — while
  `value` held `(clim - hist)/hist*100`. So a precipitation row labelled a
  **percent** as `mm/day`. Right for absolute variables, wrong for relative ones:
  the same name-vs-semantics split 5e exists to end, surviving one layer up.
* **Three columns were structurally dead.** `horizon_window_effective` and
  `n_years_dropped` were hardcoded empty, and `absolute_value` was never populated
  in the annual table because the companion only existed on the monthly path.
  (The *effective horizon window* itself is no longer dead: `horizon_window` now
  carries it, in the same form as `reference_window` — see below. What was removed
  was a second, permanently-empty column beside a nominal one, not the concept.)
* **Eight columns were constant or redundant.** `dataset` was literally
  `institution + "/" + source_id`, split apart again on read.

The schema now carries three values per row, each with fixed semantics:

* ``reference_value`` — the **baseline level** (25.0567), in ``units``.
* ``absolute_value`` — the **future level** (26.2354), in ``units``.
* ``relative_value`` — **relative to the baseline**, per the spec's ``change``
  field: a difference for an `absolute` variable (+1.1787 degC), a percent for a
  `relative` one (+10.95). ``relative_units`` says which.

Nothing is inferred from a variable name, and there is no column whose meaning
depends on which row you are reading.

The two window columns report the SAME kind of thing in the SAME form:
``reference_window`` and ``horizon_window`` are both the effective bounds from
``hydrological_year_bounds`` — the complete hydrological years the arithmetic
actually used — written ``%Y-%m-%d / %Y-%m-%d``. ``horizon_window`` used to be the
config's nominal year pair (``2070-2090``) beside an effective reference span,
which made two adjacent columns disagree about both meaning and format.

The dry-month rule (6b) falls out natively: a flagged month has ``relative_value``
empty, both levels present, and ``status = reference_below_threshold``. Shipping
the reference is what keeps 6b's promise exactly — the rule drops the meaningless
ratio and keeps the informative difference, and the difference is
``absolute_value - reference_value`` on every row, flagged or not.

This module is a **reshape, not a recomputation** — every value it emits comes
from the dataset stage B persisted (falsifier M3).

    coordinates `(clim_project, model, scenario, horizon, member, stats)`, plus
    the `__reference`, `__level` and `__flagged` companions.

    ``month`` is ``None`` for the annual table and the month number for the
    monthly one. The two tables no longer share a schema — the `period` column
    that made them concatenable was constant in one and the key in the other, and
    no consumer stacked them.

    ``window_facts`` is a single dict of run-level window provenance, passed
    rather than recomputed so the table cannot disagree with `composition.csv` or
    `provenance.json` about the same run.

    ``row_facts`` maps `(model, scenario, member, horizon)` to per-row overrides.
    It exists because the **effective** window bounds are a property of a series,
    not of the run: they come from ``hydrological_year_bounds``, applied to the
    data each combination actually has. The horizon is part of the key because the
    effective *horizon* window depends on it; the reference window does not, and
    is simply repeated across a point's horizons.

    ``variable_spec`` maps variable name to a spec exposing ``.units`` and
    ``.change``. It is what decides whether ``relative_value`` is a percent or a
    difference — never the variable's name.

    Two reasons, one change. Excel prompts "By default, Excel will perform the

    17 significant digits (108 such cells in the annual table, 1296 in the
    monthly); fixed-point output is the only conversion trigger these files carry,
    and it removes it. And fixed-point never emits an exponent, so a near-zero
    ratio cannot arrive as `1.2345e-06` — the form Excel converts most eagerly.

    This is a SERIALIZATION concern only. The rows stay exact in memory and the
    `scalar/*.nc` series keep full precision; R8 step 5c deliberately removed
    quantisation from the STORED series because it fed downstream arithmetic, and
    nothing downstream reads these CSVs (`plot_climate_proj_timeseries` declares
