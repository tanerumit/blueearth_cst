    The reviewed binding (ADR 0010) is a statement about seven variables, not
    about the size of a catalog entry: what P1 established is the arithmetic
    `extract_historical_climate.py` applies to `precip`, `temp`, `temp_min`,
    `temp_max`, `press_msl`, `kin` and `kout`. An upstream catalog that also
    describes variables this toolbox never reads says nothing about those seven,
    so it is accepted; an upstream catalog that touches one of them in a way the
    review did not cover is rejected.

    Concretely, an adapter departs when any of these holds:

    - a reviewed conversion is missing or has a different value;
    - it converts a reviewed variable the review left unconverted (an extra
      `unit_add`/`unit_mult` entry keyed on one of the seven) — e.g. a
      `unit_mult: {precip: 1000}` that would silently rescale precipitation;
    - it renames some other native variable ONTO a reviewed name, which would
      shadow the reviewed source of that variable.

    Everything else is surplus description and is ignored. Rejecting it was the
    behaviour before ADR 0010, and it made the guard a version pin on one
    catalog file rather than a check on the arithmetic: hydromt's own
    `deltares_data` catalog states the identical seven conversions and adds
    `d2m`/`u10`/`v10` renames plus an `ssr` scale, and was refused for it.
