"""Rule 1.11: outlet and user-gauge discharge series share ONE id namespace.

A gauge that sits on the basin outlet appears in BOTH ``Q_outlets`` and
``Q_gauges_<name>`` under the SAME ``index`` — the outlet's subcatchment id is
that gauge's ``wflow_id`` whenever the model was delineated as a subbasin at
the gauge, which is the normal way to build one. The two series then disagree
about ``station_name`` (synthetic ``wflow_1`` vs the user's own name) and
``xr.merge`` raises ``MergeError: conflicting values for variable
'station_name'``. Observed 2026-08-02 on a real basin (gauge 101, "outlet"),
where it killed rule 1.11 outright after the 2026-08-01 fix to
``blueearth_cst/shared/gauges.py`` made the gauge series resolvable in the
first place — the collision had been masked by the gauges never being found.

The outlet series must WIN the collision. That was once a filename
requirement — rule 1.15 declared ``hydro_wflow_1.png`` and every figure was
written as ``<kind>_{station_name}.png`` — and since 2026-08-10 the figures are
keyed by ``wflow_id`` and none is declared. What the tests below pin is the
MERGE itself: a deterministic winner, the outlet's values surviving, and the
gauge-only stations coming through untouched.
