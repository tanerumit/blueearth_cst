"""Stage the wf1 leaves WF2/WF3 declare and Snakemake will not satisfy on its own.

A CROSS-WORKFLOW LEAF is a file some rule in WF2 or WF3 declares as an input
while no rule in that workflow declares it as an output. Snakemake cannot
produce it, so anything driving WF2/WF3 in isolation — a dry-run test, the
layout scaffolder — has to put it on disk first. This module puts it there.

**The leaf LIST is not defined here.** It moved to
`blueearth_cst/shared/cross_workflow_leaves.py` on 2026-08-17, when
`scripts/run_workflows.py` needed it for a preflight: that is a run path, and
AGENTS.md's invocation-model split makes `dev/scripts/` never part of a run. The
names are re-exported below, so every consumer of this module is unaffected —
read the shared module for why the list is one definition rather than three, and
for the test that proves it complete and minimal.

**What stayed here is the STAGING**, which is test-fixture machinery with no
run-path caller: `stage`, `content_for`, the minimal file bodies, and the
`EXTRA_*` non-leaves below.

**Extras are not leaves.** Both test fixtures also stage files the DAG does not
require, for reasons that are real but separate — see `EXTRA_*` below. They are
passed explicitly so that "required by Snakemake" and "wanted by this caller"
stay legible; folding them into `LEAVES` is how the vestigial ones survived.
