Drives `tests/_stage_equiv_harness.py` in a subprocess so it runs against the

# The child normally finishes in ~30 s locally and a few minutes on a CI
# runner, so this is a HANG DETECTOR, not a performance budget -- it must never
# fire on a slow-but-working machine.
#
# Why it exists: on 2026-08-09 this test hung the windows CI leg. The suite
# reached 89 % at 18:56:55, printed nothing for 24 minutes, and the job was
# killed by `timeout-minutes: 30`. An unbounded `subprocess.run` cannot do
# anything else -- the parent waits forever, pytest never reports, and the log
# ends mid-progress-bar with no indication of which test stalled or why.
#
# That is also why the flake hunt on the same day found nothing in 15 runs
# (t2608071208): it counted failures, and a hang never produces one. Bounding
# the child converts the next occurrence from a 30-minute kill with no
# information into a normal test failure carrying the child's partial output.
# It does NOT fix the underlying stall -- see that item.
#
# 600 -> 240 on 2026-08-21 (owner ruling, t2608071208). The bound governs how
# long an OCCURRENCE costs, and ten minutes of waiting is most of what
# investigating one costs. 240 s keeps the headroom the paragraph above demands
# -- roughly 15x the 12-16 s passing runs, and still above the "few minutes" a
# CI runner takes -- while capturing the same evidence: the harness arms
# `faulthandler.dump_traceback_later(120, repeat=True)`, so a stalled child
# dumps every thread's stack at 120 s and again at 240 s. The three further
# dumps 600 s bought never told anyone anything the first two had not.
