"""One record per climate variable (R14 `C-57`, design D-10.6).

Before this, a variable was described in two places that did not know about each
other: ``CLIMATE_VARS`` in ``climate_analysis/climate_figures.py`` said how to
PLOT it, and every project's ``variables:`` block said what it MEANS. The second
had no defaults at all — `C-57` called the short form "registry-resolved" and
there was no registry — so every config restated the same four fields for the
same two variables, and a typo in any of them was a valid config.

**This module is in ``shared/`` because variable metadata already crosses
workflows.** ``CLIMATE_VARS`` is read by WF0's figures and by WF1's
``plot_map_forcing``; the projections spec is read by WF2. A home under
``projections/`` would have been wrong on the day it landed.

**Two attribute groups, deliberately not merged.**

* :class:`Presentation` — how a reader sees the variable. Axis label, the unit
  the FIGURE is drawn in, and how the variable aggregates in time.
* :class:`ProjectionSpec` — what WF2 needs to difference it: the post-rename
  source name, the canonical quantity, the units that quantity is stored in, and
  whether a change is relative or absolute.

They overlap on nothing, and the one field that looks shared is the trap:

    Presentation.unit    for `precip` is  "mm"       — a yearly TOTAL
    ProjectionSpec.units for `precip` is  "mm/day"   — a monthly mean RATE

Both are right for their reader. Collapsing them because two spellings of one
word sit next to each other would mislabel every figure axis or every change
factor, depending which way the collapse went, and nothing downstream would
raise. ``tests/test_variable_registry.py`` pins the INEQUALITY for that reason.

**``projections`` is nullable, and that is information rather than an omission.**
``pet`` is plotted and is not a CMIP6 variable this toolbox differences, so it
has no projection spec — and a variable in the registry with no spec gets a
different refusal from a variable that is not in the registry at all. One says
"declare it long-form", the other says "add it to the registry", and each is
the true remedy for its case.

The registry is toolbox VOCABULARY, not a project surface: the long form of
``variables:`` stays valid, so a project can always declare a variable the
registry has never heard of without editing code.
