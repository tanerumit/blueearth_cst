"""Reference-window clipping and its warnings (design §5.4 D1, step 5e).

The change-factor reference is the GCM **historical** experiment, which ends
2014-12-31. A configured reference window reaching past that cannot be satisfied,
and the design's ruling (R1) is to **clip, never splice**: 2015+ exists only under
the per-scenario ScenarioMIP entries, and stitching them onto the historical tail
would silently mix two experiments inside one reference (N8).

The interesting part is not the clip — it is *which conditions warn where*. D1
separates three, on the principle that **a signal that fires on every run is a
signal nobody reads**:

===================  ==================  =========================================
condition            stderr at DAG build  durable record
===================  ==================  =========================================
clip                 yes                  requested + effective + ``clipped``
alignment differs    **no** by default    both windows + ``reference_alignment``
short window         yes                  effective length in years
===================  ==================  =========================================

Alignment is silent by default for a concrete reason: the shipped seed config has
``historical_year_range: [1990, 2010]`` against ``shared.historical_window``
2000–2020, so the two differ on **100 %** of runs. Warning there would train the
reader to filter the channel. It is promoted to stderr only when the windows
*would have been equal but for the clip* — the case where the user plausibly
intended alignment and did not get it.
