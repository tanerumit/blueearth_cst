"""Readable per-variable tables derived from wflow's ``output.csv``.

Wflow writes ONE csv, at full float precision, with columns in its own internal
order and ISO-8601 timestamps: ``time,Q_101,Q_1040,Q_1020,...``. That file is not
ours to reformat -- ``plot_results.py`` reads it back through
``WflowSbmModel.output_csv``, so its layout is an interface with hydromt's reader
(AGENTS.md: do not re-engineer how hydromt handles data).

So this DERIVES rather than rewrites. The raw file stays byte-for-byte as wflow
wrote it; the tables here are a product, and being a product is what makes the
per-variable split free: the variable moves into the filename, which is what lets
the columns carry bare station ids without ``Q_1`` becoming ambiguous against a
positional outlet (the ambiguity ``shared/gauges.py`` exists to prevent).

Three differences from the raw file, each fixing something measured on a real
basin (``C:/TESTS/CST/gabon_1008``, 2026-08-10):

* **Five decimal places.** Values carried up to 21 characters
  (``0.00343887581965451``). Sub-millimetre precision on discharge from an
  uncalibrated global-data model is noise, and it cost 58% of the file. The cap
  is on DECIMAL PLACES rather than significant digits, so wflow's spin-up
  values around 1e-39 read as ``0`` instead of as forty leading zeros -- see
  ``_format_value``.
* **No scientific notation.** 502 of 7670 rows held values like ``9.86e-5``.
  Excel renders those as ``9.87E-05``, which is a display most people then have
  to fight. The decimal cap removes the need for it entirely.
* **Dates, not timestamps.** ``2000-01-02T00:00:00`` imports as TEXT, not a
  date, because of the ``T``. Dropping the time part entirely gives ``2000-01-02``,
  which Excel parses as a date.

  The intermediate form -- ``2000-01-02 00:00:00``, a space instead of the ``T``
  -- was worse than either, and shipped until 2026-08-10. It parses as a
  DATETIME, and a datetime is then re-rendered in the reader's locale: the same
  file shows ``2000-01-02`` on one machine and ``02-01-2000 00:00`` on the next,
  which is what the owner hit. A date-only string is unambiguous under
  ISO-8601 and carries no zero time-of-day for a locale to reformat.

Columns are sorted numerically, not lexically: as text, ``1010`` sorts before
``101``, and station ids are integers.

    The cost, stated because it is real: anything under 5e-6 renders as ``0``.
