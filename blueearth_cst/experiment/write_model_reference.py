"""Record which model state an experiment used (R9 P4, design *Model
reproducibility contract*).

There is ONE mutable live Wflow model, and experiments are long-lived. Without a
record, re-running an old experiment after the model is rebuilt silently mixes
new physics or state into old results. This writes
``experiments/<id>/config/model_reference.yml``: the model's relative path, a
pointer-derived digest, and the per-input hashes the digest was built from.

**A path plus a digest — the model is not copied.** Copying would duplicate a
multi-hundred-MB staticmaps per experiment to answer a question a hash answers.

**The per-input hashes are recorded, not just the digest.** A bare digest can
only report that *something* moved; the guard that reads this file has to name
the changed input, or an operator cannot act on it.
