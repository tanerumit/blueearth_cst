"""The batched Wflow driver's console contract (rule 3.15).

``blueearth_cst/experiment/run_wflow_batch.jl`` cannot be unit-tested the way a
Python module can — running it needs Julia, an instantiated project and Wflow
itself, which is what ``--run-integration`` is for. What CAN be checked cheaply
is the part the console depends on, and the part that silently rots: the SHAPE
of the rows it prints.

That shape is load-bearing rather than cosmetic. Rule 3.15 is the toolbox's
longest step, and Wflow is silent on the terminal there (``[logging] silent =
true``, set so Julia's box-drawing records do not swamp the console), so these
rows are the only thing a batch emits while it works. They are also the only
rows in the toolbox written in Julia, so nothing else in the suite would notice
them drifting out of the house format.
