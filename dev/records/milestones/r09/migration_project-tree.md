# Migration — project tree (R9)

Status: **COMPLETE** (2026-08-04), **amended 2026-08-04** after P1 encoded it.
All three original findings resolved, every artifact class placed, rule
precedence stated, and the validating inventory ruled.

**Amendment 2026-08-04 — three rows, ruled by the owner on the P1 falsifier's
evidence** (`phase-1-report.md` F1a–F1c; run:
`2026-08-04_p1-declared-tier-falsifier.md`). Applying the encoded map to the
declared-tier inventory reported three artifacts with no row. This is the map
being corrected by the instrument built to test it, which is what gate 1 is for.

| # | Artifact | Ruling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F1a | `spatial/geoms/region.geojson` (rule `delineate_region`) | `data/` row generalised to `spatial/geoms/*`, and Finding 2's "correspond exactly" claim corrected |
| F1b | `config/runs/climate_projections/<digest>/` | `config/` row generalised from `model_creation` to `<workflow>` |
| F1c | `experiments/<id>/config/runs/climate_experiment/<digest>/` | new identity row in the experiments section, under P9 |

**Second amendment 2026-08-04 — the observed tier.** One clean three-workflow
run from the primary checkout settled the two gaps that no declaration could
reach, and retired a row:

| # | Artifact | Ruling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F2 | `hydrology_model/instate/` | **No row.** The directory does not exist; the candidate was inferred from the design tree and never observed |
| F2 | `hydrology_model/plots/` as a directory | **No change.** The tree holds exactly `basin_area.{png,pdf}`, so the two-file row is right as written |
| G2 | `config/generated/wflow_build_model_run.yml` | **Row dropped.** Nothing in the codebase writes it any more — only `wflow_build_forcing_historical.yml` is generated — so the row, and the second *named precedence hazard* built on it, described an artifact that cannot appear |

`semantic_tree_diff.R09_MAP_GAPS` is now empty: every candidate is closed, three
into the map and two out of it. The observed tier is
`observed_inventory.txt` — 201 paths, zero unmapped.

**Third amendment 2026-08-05 — one row, found by reading rather than by any
instrument.** P5 noticed that `scripts/run_workflows.py` writes an immutable
invocation manifest to `<project_dir>/provenance/runs/`, a **seventh project
root** appearing in zero rows here and zero lines of the design tree. Ruled the
same day: it moves under `config/runs/`, where the per-run generated provenance
already lives.

| # | Artifact | Ruling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F3 | `provenance/runs/*.json` (`scripts/run_workflows.py`) | Relocated to `config/runs/invocations/`; new row in the `config/` section, and the inventory's blind spot documented under *What the inventory does not cover* |

The more useful half is **why nothing caught it**: every tier of the inventory
is Snakemake-derived, and the wrapper is not a rule. That limit is now stated
in this document rather than left to be rediscovered.

Date: 2026-08-04

Purpose: the old → new path map mandated by `naming.md` §7, and the artifact
inventory the design names as a precondition for a task brief. Consumed three
ways — by `semantic_tree_diff` to gate the migration, as the internal rename
record, and by the task brief.

## Method and sources of truth

| Source | Standing |
| --- | --- |
| `output:` declarations in the three Snakefiles | **Authoritative** for what the current code emits |
| Undeclared engine artifacts (hydromt, Wflow.jl, weathergenr) | Authoritative only when observed; not visible to `--dry-run` |
| `test_case/test_local` materialized tree (240 files) | **Cross-check only — NOT an inventory.** See below |
| `build_r07_path_map` in `semantic_tree_diff.py` | Template for the map's regex form; describes pre-R7 → R7, not R7 → R9 |

**The fixture is a mixed-era tree and must not be used as the inventory.** It
carries at least three eras at once: WF2 log parts from rules the v2 rework
merged away (`2.03_monthly_change/`, `monthly_stats_fut/`, `monthly_stats_hist/`),
both the batched and the pre-batch WF3 wflow log shapes
(`3.10_run_wflow/batch_N.log` *and* `3.10_run_wflow/rlz_<r>_cst_<c>.log`),
unmerged WF3 log parts sitting directly in `logs/` rather than under `_parts/`,
and **no `spatial/` subtree at all** — the ADR 0003 spatial artifacts postdate it.
Anything mapped from the fixture alone would bake those orphans into the contract.

---

## Finding 1 — RULED: the project's `config/` is generated, not editable

The design's settled framing states *"`config/project.yml` is the editable
project source of truth"* and the tree labels `config/` **"editable project
source"**. Neither holds today.

`<project_dir>/config/` is written **in its entirety** by rule 1.01
`snapshot_config` → `blueearth_cst/model/copy_config_files.py`, which creates
`config/catalogs/`, `config/templates/`, and `config/observations/`
(`copy_config_files.py:252-261`) plus `config/runs/` and the immutable
digest-keyed bundle at `config/runs/model_creation/<digest>/`. These are
**provenance snapshots of inputs that live outside `project_dir`**: the editable
source of truth is the `snake_config_*.yml` passed via `--configfile`, which
lives in the toolbox, and the catalogs/templates/observations it references by
absolute path.

There is no `project.yml` anywhere, and nothing writes one.

**The collision.** `config/catalogs/` and `config/templates/` are the *same
paths* with *opposite semantics* in the two documents: v4 labels them per-basin
editable overrides; `copy_config_files.py` writes generated snapshots there.

**RULED 2026-08-04 — option (A): the snapshot stays under `config/`**, with
editable and generated subtrees distinguished inside it. Recorded in
`project-tree-design.md` v6, which also restates P4 from *separate* to
*distinguishable*. The question was: where does the generated config snapshot
live under the v4 tree? The snapshot is a real, sizeable
artifact set — `config/runs/snake_config_<workflow>.yml`,
`config/runs/model_creation/<digest>/`, `config/catalogs/`, `config/templates/`,
`config/observations/` — and the v4 tree has **no provenance root** to receive
it. The six roots are `config/`, `data/`, `models/`, `experiments/`, `logs/`,
`benchmarks/`, and under P4 none of them is a home for per-run generated
provenance at project scope.

Options considered:

- **(A)** keep it under `config/`, distinguishing editable from snapshot inside
  it — **adopted**;
- **(B)** its own project-scope root beside `logs/` and `benchmarks/`;
- **(C)** under `logs/`, applying P7.

**Why (A).** `config/runs/snake_config_model_creation.yml` is a declared `input:`
of WF3's rule 3.00b drift guard (`Snakefile_climate_experiment:210, 290`), so the
snapshot is a consumed cross-workflow contract artifact, not an archive. (A) is
the only option that leaves that path untouched. (B) a `provenance/` root would
break it, add a seventh root, and leave project and experiment scopes disagreeing
about where the same artifact class lives. (C) `logs/` is disqualified outright:
it is what a user deletes to reclaim space, and its parts are merged-then-deleted
by design, while this bundle is immutable, retained, and read by a downstream
workflow.

The `config/` rows are mapped below. They are almost all **identity** — which is
the point: the cheapest correct answer was the one that moved nothing.

**Two related notes, neither of which blocks the map:**

1. **The Q6 ruling is wrong in its conclusion, not just its reasoning.** I ruled
   that toolbox catalogs are "referenced, never copied". They are referenced as
   inputs **and copied as provenance**. v4's tree now carries the comment
   *"toolbox catalogs are referenced, not copied"* — that line was false in the
   accepted design of record; corrected at v5 and re-ruled at v6.
2. **`config/project.yml` is new capability, not a relocation.** Nothing writes
   one; the source of truth is the `--configfile` in the toolbox. Introducing it
   moves config ownership from toolbox to project, touching `run_workflows.py`,
   the `--configfile` contract, and `suggest_experiment_name.py`. This is a
   **scope note on R9**, not a precondition for the map: it is a settled-framing
   decision and is not reopened here.

## Finding 2 — WITHDRAWN: the spatial subtree is settled

Recorded as a blocker on the strength of `master-task-brief.md`'s phase index,
which read *"P2 — implemented; Gate 2 review pending"*. **That line was stale.**
Gates 2 and 3 were both approved and `feat/wf1-spatial-decoupling` was merged to
`main` on 2026-08-02 (`29ccde9`); `ad9702d` closed the gates in
`phase-2-report.md` and `DEVLOG.md` but never updated the index. The branch is
deleted and rules 1.02 `prepare_spatial_maps` and 1.03 `build_wflow_model` are on
`main`.

The WF1 rows in this map were derived from `main`, so they already reflect the
landed work and are **final, not provisional**. The nine P1 products the report
names are five vector layers under `geoms/`, plus `location_registry.csv`,
`spatial_catalog.yml`, `spatial_maps.nc`, and `spatial_report.yml`.

**Amended 2026-08-04 (P1 falsifier, F1a).** This paragraph previously said those
nine "correspond exactly" to the `data/spatial/` rows below. They do not. The
declared-tier inventory carries a **tenth** file under `spatial/` —
`geoms/region.geojson`, written by rule `delineate_region` (ADR 0003), a
*different rule* from `prepare_spatial_maps`. The nine-product list was a
complete inventory of one rule's outputs and was mistaken for a complete
inventory of the subtree. The `data/spatial/` row is now a directory row rather
than five enumerated files, so a future layer cannot reopen the same gap. The
design tree in `project-tree-design.md` v10 does not name `region.geojson`
either; that is a documentation gap, not a placement question — the destination
is the same `geoms/` directory as the other layers.

The index line has been corrected.

## Finding 3 — RULED: three tree shapes did not match what the code emits

All three resolved **toward the code** at design v7, so none costs an
implementation change. Every one turned out to encode a prior decision, which is
what design principle P9 now generalises.

| v4 drew | Code emits | Ruling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `data/climate/historical/<source>_<window>/` | `climate_historical/<source>_<window>/` | **Key kept** — it is a cache key (P3-1 §4), not multi-window support. Framing reworded. New obligation: prune orphaned store dirs. |
| `cmip6/timeseries/` | `cmip6/raw/` **and** `cmip6/scalar/` | **Both kept.** Two tiers of one identity; `scalar/` over `series/` is R8 ruling S8-03; `prune_series_cache.py` is keyed to the grammar. |
| `cmip6/change_factors/` | two files in `cmip6/summary/` | **Kept in `summary/`.** A directory for two files violates P5. |

---

## Rule precedence — the tables are not the rule order

`apply_path_map` is **first match wins** (`dev/scripts/semantic_tree_diff.py:438`).
The tables below are grouped by destination root because that is how a human reads
them; that grouping is **not** the order the rules are registered in. Encoding the
tables top-to-bottom yields a map that is wrong on exactly the rows that matter.

**The invariant: the narrower source pattern is registered first.** Narrowness is a
property of the *old* side, not of the rule kind — a `fullmatch` regex is narrower
than a directory prefix by construction, but an exact rule placed after a prefix
that covers it never fires. `build_r07_path_map` interleaves its three kinds for
this reason and stays the template; do not read the invariant as a fixed
exact-before-regex-before-prefix ordering.

**Identity rules are enumerated per row, never written as a catch-all prefix.**
`apply_path_map` returns its input unchanged on fall-through, so a broad
`config/` → `config/` prefix rule is indistinguishable from no rule at all: it
would satisfy every `config/` row at once and empty the unmapped-path report by
construction, making the phase's falsifier pass unconditionally. Enumerating
identity per row is what preserves the fall-through signal that report depends on.

Two rows are live hazards. In both, a general rule for one source directory
swallows a specific destination:

| Narrow rule | General rule it must precede |
| --- | --- |
| ~~`<P>/config/generated/wflow_build_model_run.yml`~~ | **RETIRED 2026-08-04** — nothing writes the file any more, so this hazard guarded an artifact that cannot appear (phase-1 report G2) |
| `experiments/<id>/hydrology_runs/rlz_<r>/config/log.txt` → `hydrology/wflow/output/rlz_<r>_cst_<c>.log` | any `hydrology_runs/rlz_(\d+)/config/(.*)` regex, which consumes the log row |

The first hazard is why `config/generated/*` appears twice below — once under its
destination root and once under its source root. That duplication is the map
signalling that section order and rule order are different things.

## Placement of the previously unplaced classes

All closed at design v8 (and v6/v7 for two of them). One is not a pure move:

| Artifact | Home | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `data_catalog_climate_experiment.yml` | `experiments/<id>/config/catalogs/` | none (v6 ruling) |
| `cmip6/report.md` | `data/climate/projections/cmip6/report.md` | none (v7) |
| `sim_dates.csv`, `resampled_dates.csv` | `climate/weathergenr/output/` | none — `series/` renamed `output/` |
| `.model_built`, `.outputs_configured` | model root | none — sentinel rule generalised |
| `spatial/*` | `data/spatial/**` | none — final; Finding 2 withdrawn |
| Wflow's `log.txt` | `hydrology/wflow/output/rlz_<r>_cst_<c>.log` | **one-line code change** |

**Scope of the mandated rename record.** `naming.md` §7 requires an internal
rename note for `rule all` output filenames. Across this whole map that is
**exactly two files** — `Qstats.csv` → `q_indicators.csv` and `basin.csv` →
`basin_indicators.csv`. Everything else moving here is either a directory
relocation or a non-`rule all` artifact, and `series/` → `output/` is a directory
rename, so §7 does not extend to it. Stated so the implementer does not re-derive
the scope.

**The `log.txt` row is a defect, not a move.** Wflow's `[logging] path_log`
defaults to `log.txt` beside the TOML, so removing the `rlz_<r>/` level puts every
member's log at one path — and rule 3.10 batches members concurrently, making it a
race rather than an overwrite. Set `path_log` per member from the existing
layout-derived pointers, **in the same commit that removes the directory level**.
Falsifier 15 in the design is the concurrency check.

## Rule rename carried by R9

`export_wflow_results` → `derive_wflow_indicators` (rule 3.11). R9 renames its
outputs, so the old name is falsified by this milestone; the other nine rule
renames are R10. Path effect is confined to transient parts:

| Old | New |
| --- | --- |
| `logs/_parts/3.11_export_wflow_results.log` | `logs/_parts/3.11_derive_wflow_indicators.log` |
| `benchmarks/_parts/3.11_export_wflow_results.tsv` | `benchmarks/_parts/3.11_derive_wflow_indicators.tsv` |

Both are merged and deleted every run and are not baseline-pinned, so no durable
path or value changes. `LOG_RULES` must be updated in the same edit — an unlisted
label is not an error, it is a silently missing log section plus orphaned parts.

## Orphans in the fixture — do NOT map

Present on disk, produced by no current rule. They must be pruned before any
reference snapshot, or the gate will compare against them:

- `logs/_parts/2.03_monthly_change/**`, `2.0N_monthly_stats_{fut,hist}/**`
- `experiments/experiment/logs/3.*.log` at the top level (pre-merge shape)
- `experiments/experiment/logs/3.10_run_wflow/rlz_<r>_cst_<c>.log` (pre-batch shape)
- `experiments/experiment/config/deltares_data.yml` (superseded by `config/catalogs/`)

`dev/scripts/prune_series_cache.py` covers the WF2 series class only; the log-part
orphans are not covered by it.

## The inventory the map is validated against — RULED (two tiers)

Step 5 asked for a clean materialized fixture, on the correct grounds that the
existing one cannot validate this map. **RULED 2026-08-04: two tiers, validated at
different times by different actors.** One instrument cannot satisfy both binding
constraints — P1 must be completable with no `project_dir` write and no
primary-checkout run, while Gate 1 must remain unable to close on declarations
alone, since undeclared engine artifacts are precisely the class `--dry-run`
structurally cannot see.

**Declared tier** — the path inventory derived from the three Snakefiles' `output:`
declarations, expanded over the seed config's wildcards. Regenerable inside a task
worktree, costs seconds, writes nothing under `project_dir`. This is what P1's
falsifier runs against, and it is sufficient for P1 to complete.

**Observed tier** — one clean three-workflow run from the **primary checkout**,
snapshotted **once** as a sorted list of project-relative paths committed under
`dev/milestones/r09/`. Not a tree copy: the map is a function over paths, so a path
list is the whole input. This is an owner action, and it is the only tier that
carries the undeclared engine artifacts.

**Sequencing.** If the observed tier does not yet exist when P1 starts, P1 runs
against the declared tier and **names the observed tier as unverified in its phase
report**. Gate 1 does not close until the map has been applied to the observed tier
with zero unmapped paths. This keeps P1 unblocked without softening the gate, and
matches the master brief's own split: the full three-workflow run is already
classed as cross-cutting, a check no single phase can perform.

**Prune before snapshotting, or the snapshot bakes the orphans into the contract.**
A run into an existing `project_dir` inherits whatever is already there. This is
not one command: `dev/scripts/prune_series_cache.py --delete` covers the WF2 series
class only, and the log-part and superseded-config orphans listed above are removed
by hand before the run is snapshotted.

### What the inventory does not cover — added 2026-08-05 (F3)

**Both tiers are Snakemake-derived, so the inventory covers RULE-DECLARED
artifacts only.** Stating the limit rather than closing it is a deliberate
choice (ruled 2026-08-05); what follows is the class it therefore misses, so
the next occurrence is found by reading this section rather than by accident.

- *Declared tier* — the three Snakefiles' `output:` declarations. An artifact
  no rule declares is invisible to it by construction.
- *Observed tier* — a tree walk after direct `snakemake` invocations. It sees
  undeclared **engine** artifacts (that is what it is for), but only those a
  rule's execution happened to produce.
- *Whole-tree `semantic_tree_diff`* — compares two trees. An artifact absent
  from both sides cancels out and is reported by neither.

**The class all three miss: artifacts written by a user-facing runner rather
than by a Snakemake rule.** The runner is not a rule, so it declares nothing;
and the observed tier was produced by direct `snakemake` invocations, so the
runner never ran and its artifacts never appeared. This is a gap in the method,
not an oversight in one document.

| `config/runs/invocations/*.json` | `scripts/run_workflows.py` | Mapped 2026-08-05 (F3). Found by a P5 read, not by any instrument — it had been writing to a seventh root, `provenance/runs/`, through the whole of R9 |

**Extend this table when a new runner-written artifact appears**, and pair it
with a map row. Closing the gap mechanically — teaching the declared tier to
enumerate runner-written paths — was considered and deferred: it needs a
declaration mechanism the runners do not have, which is its own task.

## Next steps

1. ~~Rule Finding 1~~ **done 2026-08-04** — option (A), design v6.
2. ~~Rule Finding 3's three mismatches~~ **done 2026-08-04** — design v7.
3. ~~Place the unplaced artifact classes~~ **done 2026-08-04** — design v8.
4. ~~Re-derive the WF1/spatial rows after Gate 2 closes~~ **not required** —
   Finding 2 withdrawn 2026-08-04; the rows were already derived from the landed
   work.
5. ~~Materialize a **clean** fixture from current code~~ **done 2026-08-04** —
   ruled as a two-tier inventory (declared + observed); see *The inventory the map
   is validated against*.
6. Encode the map as regex rules alongside `build_r07_path_map`, in the precedence
   order stated above.
