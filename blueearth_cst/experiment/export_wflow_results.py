"""Reduce the stress-test runs into one LONG-format indicator table per variable.

R11 CR-2. The pre-R11 writer produced two WIDE tables — ``q_indicators.csv`` with
one column per gauge, and ``basin_indicators.csv`` with one column per basin
variable — so the header grew with the gauge count and a reader had to know which
columns were locations. This emits **one table per output variable**, each with a
**fixed five-column header** that does not grow with anything:

    metric, location, st_id, rlz_id, value

The header no longer grows with the STRESS-dimension count either. The axis
columns were removed once the response-surface axis became a derivation over
``stress_test_lookup.csv``: they held an annual collapse of twelve monthly
perturbations, which misreports any seasonal design and made every other axis
unrecoverable from the results. Specification: HM-7.

``metric`` is a composite ``<variable>_<statistic>`` (``q_mean_annual_7day_min``),
so a result file is self-contained once it leaves the project tree —
``variable`` is derivable from it and needs no column of its own. The vocabulary
and the variable tokens live in ``shared/indicator_tables.py``, which is the
published contract.

**Three grain classes, and the reason they differ** (CR-2):

- **A — linear in years.** Emitted PER REALIZATION. All are "annual statistic,
  then mean over years", and realizations are equal-length, so per-realization
  values average back to the pooled value exactly. Nothing is lost by emitting
  the finer grain, and ``aggregate_rlz`` existed only to choose between grains
  that are not actually different.
- **B — non-linear fit.** Pooled only (``rlz_id = 0``). A GEV fit over one
  short realization is ill-conditioned; pooling multiplies the block sample by
  ``RLZ_NUM``.
- **C — selects a category.** Pooled only. ``idxmax()`` picks ONE month, so
  different realizations can pick different ones. The month is fixed from the
  ``st_0`` baseline and then evaluated for every member — which is what makes
  the baseline rows mandatory rather than decorative.

**Pooling pools the SAMPLE, not a spliced series.** The pre-R11 code concatenated
realizations and overwrote the index with a synthetic continuous ``date_range``,
butt-splicing them into one fictitious record. A ``rolling(7)`` window then
crossed each splice and manufactured 7-day flows that occurred in no realization,
which could become that year's annual minimum and enter the GEV block sample. For
the 7-day return level we therefore extract each realization's annual minima
*within* that realization and pool the blocks. It also removes an unstated
assumption: both methods give ``RLZ_NUM x N`` blocks only if every realization is
a whole number of years on the same calendar boundary, and nothing checks that.

    **No scientific notation.** Low-flow values reach ~1e-5, so pandas' default
    repr puts ``6.3476255e-05`` in the file, which Excel does not open cleanly.
    ``np.format_float_positional`` is what removes the exponent. Note that the
    obvious ``float_format="%.4g"`` does NOT: it still emits ``6.348e-05``.

    **Four SIGNIFICANT digits, not four decimal places.** This distinction is
    the whole reason a cap is safe to reintroduce here. The pre-R11

    error is 5e-4 — half a unit in the last kept digit, worst when the leading
    digit is 1 — against that comparator's own ``INDICATOR_RTOL`` of 1e-2, a 20x
    margin, so it cannot mask a difference the baseline gate would have caught.
    ``tests/test_export_wflow_results.py`` pins that claim to the tolerance
