"""Render toolbox figures from a project tree on disk, without running a workflow.

The figure families this toolbox ships are produced deep inside Snakemake rules,
so the normal way to look at one is to run the workflow that writes it. That is
minutes-to-hours per look, which makes iterating on a figure's *design*
impractical. This script rebuilds each family's inputs from artefacts a finished
run already left behind, and calls the same plotting function the rule calls.

    # what can be rendered, and is its input present?
    pixi run python dev/scripts/preview_plots.py --list

    # render everything available, into a scratch dir
    pixi run python dev/scripts/preview_plots.py --all

    # render one family and open the output folder
    pixi run python dev/scripts/preview_plots.py hydro --open

Renders land in ``--out-dir`` (a gitignored scratch tree by default) and NEVER
in a project's own ``plots/``: a preview must not be able to take the place of a
run product that the baseline fingerprints. Same rule as
``preview_basin_map.py``, which owns the basin map and is not duplicated here.

**Coverage is deliberately partial.** A family appears below only when its
inputs can be rebuilt HONESTLY from a finished run. Three are excluded for
stated reasons rather than forgotten:

* ``signatures`` needs observed discharge, and observations live outside the
  repository by design (``config/templates/observations/`` holds header-only
  schemas). Passing simulated discharge as if it were observed would render a
  figure that looks right and means nothing.
* the ``source_*`` / ``forcing_*`` climate maps come from
  ``plot_climate_figures``, which wants a dataset assembled by its own rule
  rather than a file on disk. Rebuilding that assembly here would duplicate the
  rule's logic, and a preview that drifts from the rule is worse than no
  preview.
* ``clim-year`` / ``clim-month`` were the per-subcatchment climate signatures.
  ADR 0006 retired that family along with its producer
  (``climate_analysis/subcatchment_climate.py``) and ``plot_clim``, so there is
  no longer a rule-side function for a preview to call. The climate a reader
  wants is the map/series family under ``forcing/plots/``, which is the second
  exclusion above.
