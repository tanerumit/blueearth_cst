"""Snakemake's own terminal output, in this toolbox's grammar.

Split out of `shared/snake_utils.py` on 2026-09-17 (t2609171028). The reason is
not tidiness -- it is that a console edit was invalidating generated scientific
artifacts.

`experiment/content_identity.repository_code_inventory` fingerprints a
TRANSITIVE STATIC-IMPORT CLOSURE from each stage's declared entry paths, and
hashes every file in it. WF3 generation now imports its scientific helpers
from `wf3_science` and its neutral tee helpers from `run_log_core`. The mixed
`snake_utils` module remains a compatibility surface for the other workflows
and owns Wflow-specific relay injection; it is outside the WF3 closure.

Nothing in this module was ever one of those nineteen. Measured before the
split: every name here is imported by ZERO closure modules -- they are reached
only from Snakefiles, which are not entry paths. They were inside the
fingerprint purely by sharing a 5,768-line file with helpers that earned their
place there. So renaming a banner invalidated a scenario collection, and a
rapid-fixture run cost ~12 minutes to recover. Twice in one session, for changes
that decide which characters reach a terminal.

**The dependency runs one way: this module imports from `snake_utils`, never the
reverse.** A convenience re-export in `snake_utils` would pull this file into
its import closures. `tests/test_module_import_direction.py` pins that direction.

The tee tier (`_Tee`, `tee_to_log`, `run_and_tee`, `log_row`, `_paint_body`,
`_compact_log_line` and friends) lives in `run_log_core`. It is genuinely
reachable from WF3's `script:` modules and remains in their code inventory.
This module holds Snakemake's parse-time console presentation.

`warn_row` lives here rather than beside `log_row`, which is a cohesion cost
paid deliberately: it is the PARSE-TIME counterpart, called from a Snakefile's
top-of-file checks before Snakemake's logging stack exists, and it is imported
by no closure module. Keeping it next to `log_row` would keep it in the
fingerprint for no benefit.

Several names imported below are private compatibility exports of
`snake_utils`. The WF3 scientific and tee modules do not import this module.

    The PARSE-TIME counterpart of `log_row`. A Snakefile's top-of-file checks
    run before Snakemake builds its logging stack and before any rule opens a
    tee, so neither :func:`install_console_style` nor :class:`_Tee` is there to
    style what they print -- and each site had invented its own spelling:
    ``warnings.warn`` (which prepends ``<file>:<line>: UserWarning:`` and echoes
    the source line under it, three lines for one sentence), a bare ``print``
    with a hand-written ``WARNING <workflow>:`` prefix, and a ``log_row`` on
    stdout. Four spellings of one thing, none of them the colour the same
    warning gets once a rule is running.

    ``HH:MM:SS - <module> - WARNING - <message>``, where ``module`` names the
    component that noticed (``config``, ``reference_window``) exactly as an
    in-run row names ``states`` or ``data_source``. **The colour is not chosen
    here**: :func:`_paint_body` reads the severity out of the row's own text, so
    this is painted by the same rule that paints a warning arriving from
    hydromt -- one funnel, not a second scheme that has to be kept in step.

    stderr rather than stdout, because a parse-time row belongs to the RUN's
    console and has no rule log to land in; that also keeps it out of a piped
    ``--dry-run`` DAG, which callers redirect.

    **From a Snakefile, keep ``module=...`` off the start of a line.**
    ``module`` is a Snakemake KEYWORD, and its parser reads a line opening with
    ``module=`` as the ``module`` directive -- ``SyntaxError: Expected name or
    colon after module keyword``, raised at parse time before any rule exists.
    A single-line call is fine (the token is then mid-expression); a call broken
    across lines is not. Build the message into a local first and pass it in one
    line, as ``generate_scenarios.smk`` does. The parameter keeps the name anyway,
    because :func:`log_row` has always spelled it that way and two names for one
    field costs more at every call site than this costs at one.

# * ``_ANSI_BODY`` (light grey) -- everything in between: a rule's own output,

# a light theme -- and one practical cost, which is that on a dark terminal it
# dims far enough to be work to read, which is what a body tier must not be when
# it is most of the output. A fixed grey is the deliberate trade, and it is
# **one constant to swap** if it reads wrong on your terminal: back to ``2``, or
# to ``90`` (bright black) for something between the two.
#
# The other two are the bright 8-colour codes, which follow the terminal's own
# palette rather than pinning an exact hue -- so they stay in whatever key the
# theme is written in. All three are swappable here and nowhere else.
#
# Two more sit OUTSIDE the routine three, for the two lines that report that
# something went wrong or might have. They are deliberately not a fourth and
# fifth tier: the three above classify every routine line, while these mark the
# exceptional one, so they appear at most twice in a run.
#
# * ``_ANSI_FAIL`` (red) -- ``run_summary``'s FAILED verdict, and nothing else.
#   Snakemake's own error block is already red, and the verdict is the line a
#   reader scrolls to the bottom to find; in the routine three it was grey.
#   The SUCCESS verdict stays uncoloured on purpose. Colouring both would make
#   the pair a status field to be read, when the whole value here is that a

    the second of those a file with escape codes in it whenever stderr happened
    to be a terminal.

    ``context`` appends a per-job suffix, and is the answer for FAN-OUT
    rules. This helper is evaluated once at Snakefile parse time, so without it
    every member of a fanned-out rule prints an IDENTICAL banner: on a
    multi-hour WF3 run the console says *something is running*, never *which
    member*. The return value becomes ``message:``, which Snakemake formats per
    job â€” so a ``context`` holding ``{wildcards.<name>}`` resolves per member
    even though the banner itself was built once.

    Two constraints on what a caller may pass:

    * Only wildcards the rule actually declares. The message is formatted
      against that job's namespace, so a stray field fails at RUN time, not at
      parse time â€” `tests/test_snake_utils.py` pins the shape, and
      `tests/test_cli.py`'s dry-run is what exercises the real namespaces.
    * **ASCII only.** A Windows console defaults to cp1252 and raises
      ``UnicodeEncodeError`` on the typographic separators that would read
      better here. Use ``|``, not ``Â·``.

    A rule with no wildcards may still pass a constant context; only the
    *interpolation* needs a wildcard, not the suffix itself.

    The context is BRACKETED (``[rlz 1 | st 2]``). Without ANSI -- a pipe, a
    redirect, CI -- the banner's fields rest on nothing but ``-`` and a double
    space, and the trimming described below removes the ``-`` from most start
    lines, leaving two adjacent runs of text separated by whitespace alone.
    Brackets keep the qualifier separable in every one of the three
    destinations, at the cost of two characters.

    ``summary`` is a plain-language clause saying what the rule DOES, for the
    rules a person waits on: ``1.13  run_historical_simulation`` is an identifier, and someone
    watching a multi-hour run should not have to know the codebase to read the
    console. Applied to the LONG-RUNNING rules only, per the parked note this
    discharges â€” a sentence on all 47 would lengthen every line to say what the
    fast ones already say by name, and the value is precisely in the rules where
    you are waiting and wondering. It is constant, so unlike ``context`` it must
    not contain a wildcard.

    Being constant is exactly why the CONSOLE prints it once per rule and not
    once per job: the long-running rules are also the FANNED-OUT ones, so a
    summary reprinted per member is the same sentence on every line of the
    longest stretch of a WF3 run â€” 400 identical clauses on a 10 x 20 grid,
    since rules 3.11 and 3.14 are one job per member. The string returned here
    is unchanged and always carries it; ``_ConsoleHandler._start_line`` does the
    trimming, because the other two destinations want the whole sentence on
    every line. The log file is grepped a line at a time, and a ``JOB_ERROR``
    block is read in isolation from whatever scrolled past hours earlier.

    Order is ``Rule <number>: <name> - <summary>  <context>``: identifier first
    because it is what the log filenames, the benchmark table and this file's
    own rule comments all key on.

    The identifier is SPELLED OUT (``Rule 1.07: build_wflow_model``) rather than
    left as a bare ``1.07  build_wflow_model``. Two digits and a dot are a rule
    number to someone who already knows this console; to everyone else they are
    an unexplained figure sitting where a version or a count could equally well
    be, and the word costs five characters once per line.

    ``quiet_start`` suppresses this rule's per-job START line; its finish line
    is unchanged. For BOOKKEEPING rules only -- a rule whose per-member work is
    a file copy attached to the member another rule just produced. WF3's
    ``3.09 retain_scenario_forcing`` is the case it was added for: it takes
    about a second, interleaves with the rule it follows, and spent two console
    lines per member, so on a 10 x 20 grid it put 800 lines into the longest
    stretch of a run to report file copies.

    What is given up, and why it is affordable: the finish line still carries
    the duration and the progress counter, so the rule is still visible and
    still timed; the heartbeat still reports a stall, since it watches the job
    wrapper rather than the console line; and a failure still prints
    Snakemake's own error block. What goes is the ability to see that such a
    rule has STARTED -- which for a rule that finishes in a second is a line
    that was already obsolete by the time it was read.

    Do NOT reach for this on a rule anyone waits on. The console's whole job
    during a long rule is to say that something is running.

    ``dynamic_progress`` marks a rule in a workflow whose job total can change
    after checkpoint expansion. Once a handler sees one, finish lines keep the
    stable completed-job numerator and omit Snakemake's provisional total.

    Side effect: records ``name -> number`` in ``_RULE_NUMBERS`` so
    :func:`install_console_style` can put the number on a job's FINISH line,
    which Snakemake reports by rule name only, and ``name -> summary`` in
    ``_RULE_SUMMARIES`` for the once-per-rule trimming above. See those
    registries' comments.

        Snakemake ends a run with its own one-line verdict and nothing about what
        the run PRODUCED. Two artifacts every run of this toolbox writes are
        consequently invisible unless you already know they exist: the merged log
        (rule W.17/W.18 folds the per-rule parts into one file, then deletes them)
        and the benchmark table (a rule column plus a TOTAL row). This names both.

        Reported as PATHS rather than contents: they are the two things a person
        needs in order to answer "what happened", and printing either inline would
        reproduce on every run the noise these console changes exist to remove.

        ``elapsed_seconds`` is optional because a Snakefile has to measure it
        itself -- Snakemake exposes no run duration to these handlers. It is
        wall-clock from Snakefile PARSE, so it includes DAG construction; that is a
        second or two on these workflows and is not worth a second clock.

        Deliberately absent: a job count. Neither handler is given one, and
        reconstructing it from the DAG would report jobs SCHEDULED rather than jobs
        RUN -- a number that reads as authoritative and is wrong whenever anything
        was already up to date.

        The failure form names the log-parts directory as well, because on failure
        the merged log does not exist yet: rule W.17 is a normal rule and does not
        run when an upstream job fails, so the per-rule parts are still the only
        record. ``show-failed-logs`` (profiles/default/config.yaml) prints the
        failing job's own log inline; this points at everything around it.

        ``log_parts_dir`` is passed rather than derived: WF3 keys its parts by
        experiment (``logs/_parts/<experiment>``), so a derived ``logs/_parts``
        would send the reader to the parent of the directory they want.

    A FAILURE is shaped like :func:`run_header` -- a ruled title, a blank, then
        one aligned column -- so a run closes in the shape it opened in. The
        ``wrote`` label and the second indent level went with the header's ``run``
        and ``path tokens`` groups on 2026-09-06.

        A SUCCESS is one line, and the asymmetry is the point: on success rule
        ``all`` has just listed every target it produced, the log and the benchmark
        table among them, so a block repeating two of those paths said nothing new.
        On FAILURE rule ``all`` never ran, the merged log does not exist yet, and
        the log-parts directory is the only record there is -- so the block that
        names it is the only place that fact appears.

        A FAILED verdict is painted red (``_ANSI_FAIL``), gated on stderr being a
        colour console. The success verdict is not painted at all: what matters is
        that a failed run looks different from every other run WITHOUT being read,

    and registers nothing in ``_RULE_NUMBERS``, so the finish line shows the
    bare name; the name must also be listed in ``_PLAN_EXCLUDED_RULES``.

    Snakemake joins a job's ``input:`` with ``", "``, which collapses a target
    aggregator's whole product list onto one unreadable line — nine absolute
    paths in a single wrap-around blob on WF2. No CLI flag changes that joiner;
    a rule's ``message:`` is the only lever, and it REPLACES the default block
    (``rule``/``input``/``output``/``jobid``/``resources``) rather than
    reformatting part of it.

    That trade is free for `rule all` specifically, which is why this helper is
    scoped to it: a target aggregator has no ``output:``, its jobid is always the
    root, and it declares no resources, so the replaced block carried nothing
    the target list does not. Do NOT reach for this on a working rule — there it
    would hide the output paths and the jobid a failure report needs.

    Indented four spaces to sit where Snakemake's own ``input:`` values sit.

    With ``project_dir`` the targets print RELATIVE to it, which is what makes a
    deep tree legible — ``data/climate/projections/cmip6/summary/x.csv`` rather
    than the same path behind 40 characters of absolute prefix. The root is then
    appended to the banner in brackets, because a relative path with no stated
    root is ambiguous: the reader must still be able to reconstruct the full
    path, and one root on one line beats repeating it nine times. Without
    ``project_dir`` the targets print exactly as given.

    Relativization is :func:`_relativize_paths`, so it strips the root in both
    native and forward-slash form — Snakefiles build these paths with ``/``

    The block had carried six full-width rules across its first thirty lines,
    and under the runner -- which is how the pipeline is actually driven -- a
    seventh sat three lines above them at a DIFFERENT width, because the runner
    draws a fixed 80 and this block sized itself to its longest value, usually
    an absolute config path. Two frames that nearly line up read as
    misalignment rather than as structure.

    What the rules were carrying, the content already carries. The table is
    numbered rows in rule order, the caption under it names what the table is
    (``9 rules | all to run | 11 jobs``), the metadata is a ``key  value``
    column, and a blank line separates each from the next. A reader never had
    to be told that a list of rule numbers was the plan.

    printing of ``wf0 analyze_climate`` within ten lines; standalone it is the
    only one, so it stays, as a bare line rather than a band.

    ``plan`` is ``(head, [(row, state), ...])`` or ``None``. A state is true
    for runnable and false for up to date. Checkpoint-dependent work is shown
    as runnable with a blank count because its fan-out is not resolved yet.
    With no plan there is no table to
    caption, so the summary goes onto the title
    (``wf2 analyze_projections -- 7 of 9 rules to run``) and no table is
    written. That branch is reached when Snakemake's job table cannot be
    parsed, and when the console style is not active -- :func:`run_header`
    never has a plan, since it is written before any job count exists. When

    A trailing ``_num`` is DROPPED from the key, and that is what makes the

    because `dev/reference/naming.md` says a count-or-index field carries the
    suffix; every banner context in WF3 writes ``rlz {wildcards.rlz_num}``,
    dropping it because on a console the column header and the value are
    adjacent and the suffix says nothing the value does not. Until this, the
    start line said ``[rlz 1 | st 2]`` and the finish line under it said
    ``[rlz_num 1 | st_num 2]`` — one fact, two spellings, which is the exact

    ``done in planning`` where a job count would be. The gutters survive a
    pipe, redirect and CI where colour does not.

    FLUSH LEFT, like every other line the opening block writes. The block was
    indented two spaces until 2026-09-17, which put the rules one column in from
    the title that introduces them and from the metadata rows below them.

    The gutter COLUMN is dropped outright when no rule is up to date -- not
    reserved and left blank. A mark on every line carries no information (the
    head line already says ``all to run``), and an empty column is three spaces
    of indent on every row of a first run, which is exactly what going flush

class _ConsoleHandler(logging.StreamHandler):
    """Snakemake's terminal handler, restyled: one line per job start and end.

    Snakemake spends SIX console lines on a job -- a blank separator, a bare
    ``[Thu Aug 13 23:26:41 2026]``, ``Job 8: <message>``, a second bare
    timestamp, ``Finished jobid: 8 (Rule: check_project_consistency)`` and
    ``1 of 37 steps (3%) done`` -- plus ``Select jobs to execute...`` and
    ``Execute N jobs...`` per scheduling wave. On a WF3 run that is thousands
    of lines in which one line per job is ours. This renders two::

        23:26:44 - RUN  Rule 3.10: generate_weather_realizations - generate ...
        23:27:14 - DONE Rule 3.10: generate_weather_realizations  0:00:30  [8/37]

    On a FANNED-OUT rule the summary clause is printed on the first member only
    and trimmed from the rest (:meth:`_trim_summary`), so the run's longest
    stretch reads as a list of members rather than one sentence restated a few
    hundred times::

        16:16:57 - RUN  Rule 3.14: downscale_scenario_series - downscale ...  [rlz 2 | st 0]
        16:16:57 - RUN  Rule 3.14: downscale_scenario_series  [rlz 2 | st 2]
        16:16:58 - RUN  Rule 3.14: downscale_scenario_series  [rlz 2 | st 3]

    The stamp is followed by ``- `` and a padded marker, so these lines open in
    the same grammar as every row :func:`log_row` and the tee emit between them
    (``23:26:51 - geoms - Writing geoms to ...``) and the identity lands in one
    column on both. Note the two ``-`` on a start line separate different
    things: the first ends the stamp, the second introduces the rule's
    plain-language summary.

    Start lines are painted blue and finish lines green, WHOLE-LINE, with
    everything else on the console light grey (``_ANSI_RUN`` / ``_ANSI_DONE``
    / ``_ANSI_BODY``). Colour is applied here rather than inside ``rule_banner``
    because the banner string also reaches a log file and an error block, where
    an escape code is corruption in one and a fight with red in the other.

    Both lines carry the same ``W.NN  name`` identifier the merged log, the
    benchmark table and the rule comments key on, so one grep finds a rule's
    whole story. Timestamps are ``HH:MM:SS``, matching :func:`log_row` rather
    than introducing ``time.asctime`` as a second clock format.

    **Only the terminal changes.** Snakemake's own
    ``.snakemake/log/*.snakemake.log`` is written by a separate handler this
    never touches, so the verbose record survives for anyone who wants it.

    **Errors are delegated, never reformatted.** ``JOB_ERROR`` /
    ``GROUP_ERROR`` and every unrecognized record go to Snakemake's own
    formatter, which is what carries the ``show-failed-logs`` inline log dump
    and the input/output/shellcmd block a failure report needs. This class
    reshapes the routine path and stays out of the way on the one that matters.

    Events are compared as PLAIN STRINGS. ``LogEvent`` is a ``StrEnum``, so
    ``record.event == "job_info"`` holds for the member itself -- which keeps
    this class importable, and unit-testable, without snakemake installed.

    **``--quiet`` still means what it means**, because the inherited filter runs
    BEFORE this handler and can remove either half of a pair. ``--quiet rules``
    drops the start records, so a finish falls back to Snakemake's own
    ``Finished jobid: N (Rule: x)`` text plus our stamp and counter -- still one
    line, still naming the rule. ``--quiet progress`` drops the finish records
    entirely, leaving only start lines, which is what asking for no progress
    reporting should give; the start memo is capped so that mode cannot grow a
    dict without bound. Neither combination was hypothetical: both were run.

    Everything is guarded and FAIL-OPEN. None of this is public API, so a
    Snakemake upgrade that renames the handler or restructures the manager
    leaves the console exactly as Snakemake ships it and the run proceeds --
    a cosmetic layer must never be able to stop a workflow. The return value
    is for tests; no caller should branch on it.

    Not a Snakemake logger plugin, deliberately. That interface
    (``--logger <name>``) resolves through installed entry points, so using it
    would mean shipping and depending on a separate package to restyle our own
    console -- a new dependency for a cosmetic layer.

    The mirror image of :func:`run_summary`, and the same grammar (a head line,
    then indented ``key   value`` rows) so a run opens and closes alike -- the
    header groups and labels its rows, for the reason set out below, and is the
    longer of the two. Snakemake's own preamble names the host and job counts but
    never the PROJECT -- so a console scrolled back to, or pasted into a
    message, could not be attributed to a project, a config or an experiment
    without asking. The merged log has carried this header for some time; the
    terminal had nothing.

    ``details`` are extra rows in call order (WF3 passes ``experiment=``),
    keeping the block to what a workflow actually has rather than a fixed set
    with blanks in it.

    The run's DECLARED key folders (:func:`declare_path_tokens`) close the
    block, and they are read from the declaration rather than passed in: these
    same names are what every path in every rule's output is rewritten to, so a
    header row and a body line that disagreed would be worse than no header at
    all. One declaration, two readers.

    **Two GROUPS, blank-line separated, each under a label.** The rows are two
    different kinds of thing and read as one wall of text without the split:
    the first three answer "which run is this", while the ``<name>`` rows are a
    LEGEND -- they define the tokens every path in every line below is printed
    with. Nothing said so, which left a reader to infer from angle brackets
    alone why ``<model>`` was written that way, and the block ran on into
    Snakemake's own ``Job stats:`` with no air between them.

    The labelled rows indent one step further than the label, which is what
    makes the grouping visible without a rule or a box. :func:`run_summary`
    closes the run in the same shape, under one group labelled ``wrote``.

    Every value is FORWARD-SLASHED, including ``config`` -- which was the one
    row that was not, so a block whose whole purpose is to state paths mixed
    ``C:\\a\\b`` with ``a/b`` and read as two trees. ``config`` is also printed
    through the repo strip that every rule log line already uses, so it reads
    ``<repo>/test_case/project_config_rapid.yml`` rather than the same fact
    behind 60 characters of machine-specific prefix.
