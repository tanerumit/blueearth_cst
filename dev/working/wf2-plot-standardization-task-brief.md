# Task Brief — Prototype the standardized Workflow 2 projection figures

> **Current disposition (2026-09-27).** The owner adopted this figure set on
> 2026-08-17 and retained the cloud orientation. Production drawing lives in
> `blueearth_cst/projections/projection_plots.py`; declarations derive from
> `projection_figures.py`. The independent prototype was retired by owner
> ruling on 2026-09-24 and is recoverable from tag
> `archive/dev-scripts-2026-09-24`. The prototype instructions below are history.

## Retained plotting rulings and evidence

The toolbox-wide convention is no figure or panel titles: use `a)` / `b)`
panel labels and identify subcatchments with annotations. WF1 series use
`cartographic_map._publication_rc()`, `series_figure_size()`, constrained
layout and `supxlabel(wrap=True)`. Derived tunable values must be evaluated
in functions, so map preview overrides affect the render.

WF2 retains model-name annotations, the combined all-horizons cloud alongside
the faceted cloud, and the existing cloud orientation. Monthly plots render
the authoritative `*_change_factors_monthly.csv`, rather than independently
recomputing changes. The prototype falsifier found the old producer used an
annual historical mean and the full future series instead of corresponding
calendar months within each horizon. Across 72 rows the corrected prototype
matched the table within 0.000491% precipitation and 0.000894 °C temperature
(worst case `GFDL-ESM4 · ssp585`). The regression
`test_values_come_through_untouched` sends sentinel values 999.0 and −42.0
through the table-to-figure path to prevent a second formula returning.

The production port was checked with 53 new unit tests, 14 CLI checks and a
full suite (2538 passed, 6 skipped, 1 xfailed). Its render matched the adopted
prototype's 9 traces per overview panel, 6 cloud points and 6 monthly traces:
[production render](https://claude.ai/code/artifact/3f2d49aa-c292-4e95-8483-2485912e0d32).
The task identity `t2608091006` remains resolvable through `dev/LOG.md` after
closure; this document retains its design rulings.

The remaining sweep completed on 2026-09-27: `plot_basavg` adopts the shared
page, typography, constrained layout and export settings; the evaluation
sheets replacing `plot_hydro` / `plot_signatures` use letter-only panels with
station identity and quantity descriptions in their captions. Calculations
and declared output names are unchanged. The basin-map preview already uses
the production template. Verification covered 40 focused tests, repository
Ruff lint/format checks and inspected renders of single/multiple subcatchments,
the multi-gauge map and all four evaluation sheets. Render fixtures are
illustrative; these checks make no claim about model performance.

### Context

Canonical rules: `AGENTS.md`. Existing plotting conventions:
`blueearth_cst/shared/plot_style.py` and
`blueearth_cst/climate_analysis/climate_figures.py` — read them, reuse them,
change neither.

- WF2 is a CMIP6 plausibility overlay; it must not become an ensemble product or
  drive the WF3 stress-test grid.
- Every resolved `(model, scenario, member)` remains a separate trace or point,
  but only scenario receives a visual identity. Models and members do not appear
  in legends or receive distinct colors, markers, or line styles.
- The reference window is configuration-dependent. Monthly change means future
  calendar month versus the corresponding historical calendar month.
- The shipped monthly-change figures instead compare months with a historical
  annual mean, and the shipped monthly climatologies average the full future
  series rather than the configured horizon. **The prototype demonstrates the
  corrected semantics in its own code; it does not fix the producer.**

### Goal

Show the owner what a compact, standardized WF2 figure set would look like —
full-period overview figures plus horizon-specific monthly change-factor figures,
under corrected monthly semantics — as rendered images in a self-contained HTML
Artifact. The deliverable is a **design decision**, not a merged output contract.

### Non-goals

- **No integration.** Do not modify the producers, the workflow, the report, the
  tests, the figure inventories, or the baseline declarations. Explicitly, these
  files are out of bounds:

  ```text
  Snakefile_analyze_projections
  blueearth_cst/projections/plot_proj_timeseries.py
  blueearth_cst/projections/get_change_climate_proj_summary.py
  blueearth_cst/projections/report.py
  blueearth_cst/shared/plot_style.py        (read and reuse; do not edit)
  dev/scripts/check_baseline.py
  dev/reference/workflows/rule-index.md
  tests/**
  ```

- No new or renamed durable figure paths. Nothing is written under any
  `project_dir` — not the fixture's, not a project's.
- No cross-model/member statistics, envelopes, medians, or aggregation.
- No model/member visual ENCODING and no legend entries naming one — no model
  gets its own colour, marker or line style. **Amended 2026-08-11 (owner):** the
  change-factor cloud labels each point with its model name. A direct annotation
  identifies a point without making model a visual channel, so the rule this
  non-goal protects is intact; the earlier blanket wording ("no model/member
  label") is withdrawn and applies to legends only.
- No changes to change-factor tables, provenance, climate extraction, or
  regridding; no WF3 contact.
- No stress-test-grid overlay in the WF2 change-factor cloud.

### Allowed scope

**Permitted**

- One new prototype renderer: `dev/scripts/preview_wf2_projection_plots.py`.
- This brief.

**Approval-gated**

- The active plotting-standardization task note
  (historical task `t2608091006`, recorded in `dev/LOG.md` after closure).
  Its half-2 checkboxes for the two WF2 producers
  currently read as swept, which the reframing may falsify — but that follows
  from `dc40a22`'s disposition, which is the owner's call, not this task's.
- Any shared-helper edit. If the shared contract is genuinely missing a
  primitive, demonstrate the gap and ask; do not add it.

**Forbidden / generated**

- `config/catalogs/cmip6_data.yml`, `config/catalogs/cmip6_store_index.json`,
  `pixi.lock`, `Manifest.toml`, and run outputs under any `project_dir`.

### The prototype renderer

Model it on `dev/scripts/preview_plots.py` — same argument style, same
`--list`/`--out-dir`/`--open` ergonomics, same header docstring stating what it
rebuilds and from what.

Inherit two of its rules:

1. Renders land in a **gitignored scratch tree** (`.tmp/` by default) and never
   in any project's `plots/`. A preview must not be able to stand in for a run
   product the baseline fingerprints.
2. It rebuilds its inputs from artifacts a finished run already left behind —
   the annual and monthly change-factor CSVs under
   `data/climate/projections/cmip6/summary/` and the projection series they were
   derived from.

Break one of them deliberately, and say so in the docstring: **do not register
this as a `preview_plots.py` family, and do not call the rule-side plotting
functions.** The point of the prototype is that the rule-side functions do not
implement the proposed design. Reaching for the existing `--list` registry
re-couples the prototype to the code it is meant to bypass.

**Input requirement.** The two-horizon case is the discriminating one, and
`test_case/test_local` cannot supply it — its config declares a single horizon
(`far: [2070, 2090]`). The executor supplies a source with **≥2 configured
future horizons** and ≥2 scenarios, either a real project tree opened read-only or
a synthetic frame built in the script; state which was used in the artifact. For
WF2 series the discriminating properties are horizon count and resolved
combination count — not the layer-richness rule that governs the basin map.

### Required prototype content (checklist)

1. Adopt the shared WF1 page, typography, layout, grid, month-label, and export
   conventions by importing `plot_style`. Scenario colors used consistently;
   historical traces gray.
2. Render this proposed structure into the scratch tree, using sanitized horizon
   names and their inclusive years, so the naming can be judged alongside the
   images:

   ```text
   overview/
   ├── annual-precipitation.png
   ├── annual-temperature.png
   ├── change-factor-cloud.png
   └── change-factor-cloud-combined.png
   windows/
   └── <horizon>-<start>-<end>/
       └── monthly-change-factors.png
   ```

3. Each annual figure carries absolute and anomaly panels over the full
   historical/future series. Draw every combination; color future traces by
   scenario only; one compact legend containing historical plus scenarios, never
   models or members. State the anomaly reference window and label the
   historical/future transition.
4. The change-factor cloud carries every combination, no marginal KDEs, scenario
   color only, and zero-reference lines, in **two views**: faceted by horizon on
   identical axes (one panel when only one horizon exists), and all horizons
   combined on one pair of axes with marker encoding horizon. Both label each
   point with its model name. The combined view answers "how far does the cloud
   travel between horizons", which the faceted one cannot.
5. Each horizon figure carries precipitation change (%) and temperature change
   (°C) panels, computed against the corresponding **historical calendar month**
   using only that horizon's years, with every combination, scenario color only,
   a zero line, and month labels.
6. **No titles on any figure** — panels carry `a)`, `b)` labels instead. What a
   title would have said goes where a journal figure keeps it: the variable and
   its unit in the y-label, and the horizon, reference window and trace counts in
   the caveat line.
7. Close figures after saving.

**Owner rulings, 2026-08-11**, taken on the first rendered set and folded into
the list above:

- No titles above figures, anywhere in the toolbox — `a)`/`b)` panel labels
  instead (item 6). This is a toolbox-wide convention, not a WF2 one.
- Match the WF1 figure spec exactly, not approximately. That means
  `cartographic_map._publication_rc()`, `series_figure_size()`, CONSTRAINED
  layout and `fig.supxlabel(..., wrap=True)` for the caveat — the four decisions
  `climate_figures.py` makes. `tight_layout` is specifically wrong: the WF1 maps
  are built on constrained layout and a family that mixes the two cannot agree
  on its margins.
- Label each cloud point with its model name (item 4, and see the amended
  non-goal above).
- Keep the combined all-horizons scatter alongside the faceted one (item 4).

### Validation

Figures are terminal artifacts and nothing here is consumed by a rule, so the
integration ladder does not apply. Three rungs, no more:

| Rung | Command/check | Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| Renders | The script runs end to end and writes every declared image without an exception, for both a one-horizon and a two-horizon input | Per iteration |
| Python gates | `pixi run lint`; `pixi run format-check` — `dev/scripts/` is linted (`extend-exclude` omits it deliberately) | Once before commit |
| Visual gate | Publish a self-contained HTML Artifact with every rendered PNG embedded as a base64 `data:` URI, and inspect at final size | Once, as the deliverable |

Do not run `pytest tests/`, `tests/test_cli.py`, `tree-check`, or the figure
baseline. Nothing is written under a `project_dir`, so the baseline question does
not arise.

**Falsifiers** — demonstrate these *in the artifact*, as numbers and images
beside the figures. "No code integration" removes the pytest home for them; it
does not remove the obligation.

- **Monthly semantics** — a synthetic case with unequal monthly baselines and
  extreme values outside the selected horizon must equal a hand calculation using
  only matching months inside the horizon. Show the hand figure, the prototype's
  figure, and what the shipped definition would have produced, so the correction
  is visible as a number and not only as a claim.
- **Combination preservation** — trace/point counts equal the resolved
  combinations. State both counts. Fewer marks disproves the
  no-aggregation/no-dropping claim.
- **Scenario-only identity** — legend labels equal historical plus configured
  scenarios, and no model or member gets its own colour, marker or line style.
  Amended 2026-08-11: a model NAME annotated beside a cloud point is permitted
  and expected; a model in a legend, or encoded in the ink, still fails.
- **Multi-window navigation** — the two-horizon input produces both window
  directories and matching cloud panels. A missing or mixed window fails.
- **Read-only** — if a real project tree is the source, hash it before and after
  the render; any change at all is a defect in the prototype.

### Acceptance criteria

- The Artifact shows every figure in the proposed set, at final size and legible
  at 180 mm width, including the two-horizon case.
- All combinations remain visible, with scenario as the only visual grouping;
  legends contain no model/member names; cloud marginals are absent. Cloud points
  carry model-name annotations, and those annotations do not overprint each
  other, the markers, or the legend.
- No figure carries a title; every multi-panel figure carries `a)`/`b)` labels.
- Monthly changes agree with the authoritative horizon-specific change-factor
  tables for precipitation and temperature, with the agreement shown.
- Figures visually match WF1 typography, dimensions, grids, labeling, and export
  quality.
- The repository is unchanged apart from the prototype script and this brief, and
  no `project_dir` was written to.
- The owner can answer "adopt this design, or not" from the Artifact alone.

### Commit plan

| Subject | Paths | Invariant preserved |
|---|---|---|
| Prototype the standardized WF2 projection figures | `dev/scripts/preview_wf2_projection_plots.py`, `dev/wf2-plot-standardization-task-brief.md` | Pathspec-scoped to the two files; no producer, workflow, test, or output-contract path is touched, so the WF2 figure contract is exactly as it was before the commit. |

### Output requirements

- The prototype script, committed.
- A self-contained HTML Artifact showing every proposed figure, including a
  ≥2-horizon case, with the falsifier evidence beside it.
- A short design note: what changes versus the shipped figures, which plotted
  values move because the monthly definition/window is corrected, and what the
  integration would cost if adopted.
- Exact commands run, results, anything skipped, and residual risks.
- A closing question asking the owner to adopt, amend, or reject the design.

### Task constraints

- Worktrees may run the prototype, pytest, lint, formatting, and dry-runs. Do not
  run a workflow from a worktree.
- Read project trees read-only. Do not write into, regenerate, or delete existing
  project outputs.
- Preserve public data-table schemas and the one-combination-one-mark rule.
- Use UTF-8, existing scenario identifiers internally, and presentation labels
  such as `SSP2-4.5` in figures.
