"""Shared helpers for the BlueEarth-CST Snakefiles.

Imported by all three ``Snakefile_*`` entry points (and ``tests/conftest.py``)
so the ``get_config`` contract lives in exactly one place. Each Snakefile makes
this module importable regardless of the working directory by prepending its
own directory to ``sys.path`` before importing — see
``dev/r03/model-builder-design.md`` §3.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config : Mapping

    arg : str

    default : Any, optional
        Value returned when ``arg`` is absent and ``optional`` is True.

    Returns
    -------
    Any

        values, which are returned as-is rather than replaced by ``default``.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError

def tee_to_log(log_path):
    """Tee ``sys.stdout``/``sys.stderr`` to ``log_path`` for a ``script:`` rule.

    Snakemake does not auto-redirect ``script:`` output to the rule's ``log:``
    (unlike ``shell:`` rules), so a script wraps its body in this manager and
    passes ``snakemake.log[0]``.

    Contract (R3 design §6):
    - creates ``log_path`` and any missing parent directories;
    - both streams are restored in a ``finally`` — the redirection cannot leak
      past the ``with`` block even if the body raises;
    - the exception is **re-raised** (not swallowed), so the traceback still
      reaches Snakemake and the rule fails loudly rather than leaving an empty
      log that Snakemake would read as a finished product.

    Parameters
    ----------
    log_path : str | os.PathLike
        Destination log file. Callers pass the rule's unique
        ``snakemake.log[0]`` so concurrent jobs never share a path.
