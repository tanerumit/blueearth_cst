# --- The shared vector foundation (ADR 0006 §8) -------------------------------
# `parse_spatial_config(basin_cfg)` WITHOUT `my_cfg`: §8b requires the shared
# rule's params to be a pure function of `project` + `shared.basin`, so a
# workflow-local key cannot feed it and the four declarations stay identical.

# --- One climate store per candidate source -----------------------------------
# Built from the SAME factory the other three workflows splat, once per source.
# For `shared.clim_historical` the resulting spec is identical to the one WF1's
# rule 1.03 declares -- same script, inputs, params and outputs -- so the store
# this workflow writes is the store WF1 and WF3 read, at the same path, and
# whichever workflow runs first builds it.
#
# THE PATH CONVENTION IS DELIBERATE AND LOAD-BEARING. Candidate stores land in
# `data/climate/historical/<source>_<window>/` beside the project's own, not in
# a separate evaluation bin, so a candidate that WINS the comparison is already
# extracted: switching `shared.clim_historical` to it costs nothing and re-runs
# no extraction. `dev/scripts/prune_climate_store.py` already reports on exactly
# this directory family.
#
# `historical_window` IS A CEILING FOR A CANDIDATE, NOT A DEMAND. CHIRPS begins
# in 1981, a locally staged subset begins wherever the staging did, and a window
# one candidate cannot fill is the ordinary case of two datasets with different
# records -- not a misconfigured project. Each source is extracted over the
# widest span it holds inside the window, and the narrowing is logged
# (`shared/climate_window.py`).
#
# The MIN_HISTORICAL_YEARS floor splits with it, because its reason does:
# weathergenr's wavelet minimum binds the source that FEEDS the pipeline, and an
# extra candidate ends at a comparison figure. So the primary keeps the floor --
# its spec stays byte-identical to WF1's and WF3's, which is what
# tests/test_climate_store_contract.py pins -- and the extras relax it to a
# logged warning. A relaxed store cannot be promoted silently: WF1 and WF3
# declare the store WITHOUT the flag, so switching `shared.clim_historical` onto
# a candidate changes the params, re-extracts, and meets the floor there.

# --- rule numbering -----------------------------------------------------------
# `W.NN` = the rule's position in this workflow's LOGICAL order. `W` is a
# workflow ID, not a position (dev/reference/naming.md §9), and IDs need not
# start at 1: this workflow is 0 because it precedes model creation, so
# `ls logs/` sorts wf0, wf1, wf2, wf3 in execution order without renumbering
# the three that already exist.
#
# No numbers are reserved: the reserved 0.07-0.09 band was dropped in the
# 2026-09-24 rule-naming migration. The evaluation rules (t2608181139) take
# numbers when they are built.
#
# DO NOT RENUMBER TO INSERT A RULE. Use a letter suffix (0.04b).

# --- log layout ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Every logging rule writes a PART under logs/_parts/, and rule 0.07 merges the
# parts into ONE logs/wf0_analyze_climate.log, then deletes them.
#
# LOG_RULES is the merge order: rule LABELS, not part paths, and for a fan-out
# rule the label is SINGULAR. Rules 0.03 and 0.04 are generated once per
# candidate source, so each writes into a DIRECTORY named for the label
# (`0.03_extract_climate_datasets/<source>.log`) and merge_logs lists that
# directory to find its members -- the fan-out width lives only in the rule that
# owns it. Same shape as WF4's `4.05_run_wflow_simulations`, whose rule
# identifiers are `run_wflow_simulations_batch_<b>`.

# rule-number order.
