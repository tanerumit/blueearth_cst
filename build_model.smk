# tests/test_region_rule.py parses all three workflows and fails on ANY other

# --- The shared vector foundation (ADR 0006 §8) -------------------------------

# fails on ANY difference beyond message/log/benchmark.
#
# `parse_spatial_config(basin_cfg)` WITHOUT `my_cfg`, deliberately, and this is
# the one call site where that differs from the module-level `spatial_cfg`
# above: §8b requires the shared rule's params to be a pure function of
# `project` + `shared.basin`, so the deprecated
# `workflows.build_model.output_locations` fallback cannot feed it.
#
# THE COST WAS REAL AND SILENT, AND IS NOW REFUSED AT THE SEAM. Rule 1.06 used
# to receive `my_cfg` and so honoured the legacy key on its way to the
# partition. A config that set ONLY `workflows.build_model.output_locations`
# then reached this rule with no gauge points at all, so its parent basins fell
# back to the AUTOMATIC partition: different subbasins, a different
# location_registry.csv, and different wflow_id values — with no error, because
# an absent gauge file is a legitimate configuration. Rule 1.09 would then add
# gauges to a model whose subbasins were derived without them.
#
# That is no longer reachable. §8b leaves no alternative on this side — a params
# payload drawn from a section the projections-only configs do not have would
# differ per invoking workflow — so the asymmetry is refused one level up
# instead: `resolve_gauge_points_path` RAISES on a legacy-only config, at the
# module-level `parse_spatial_config` call above (line 47), before the DAG is
# built. Both keys naming the same path still parse. A migrating project is
# therefore stopped at parse time with the canonical key spelled out, rather
# than told the old one is deprecated and left to discover the partition moved.
#
# Fixed 2026-08-08 after a real project hit it: five automatic outlets in the
# registry, observations declaring the four station ids the gauge file pinned,
# and the failure surfacing at rule 1.15 a whole model build later. No tracked
# config was ever affected (all set `shared.basin.gauge_points`, the canonical
# key, checked 2026-08-06), which is why the suite stayed green throughout.

# Rule numbering (comment headers + log/benchmark filenames) uses `W.NN` = the
# rule's position in this workflow's LOGICAL order — data, then model build,
# then run, then records. Contiguous, and every dependency points from a lower
# number to a higher one, so a rule can never depend on something numbered after
# it. Positional since [R10-5] (2026-08-06); it used to be a stable identifier
# assigned at rule creation, which left it uncorrelated with anything.
#
# STILL A READING AID, NOT EXECUTION ORDER. Snakemake resolves execution from
# the DAG, so rules on separate branches run concurrently — 1.11-1.13 are
# parallel leaves off 1.10, and 1.04's climate branch runs beside the whole
# model build. Low-to-high says "cannot depend on", not "runs before".
#
# DEFINITION ORDER IN THIS FILE IS NOT THE NUMBER ORDER, and is not required to
# be: module-level code is interleaved between rules and depends on its position
# (`_basavg_pngs` before 1.15, `_source_plot_inputs` before 1.05), so reordering
# the blocks to match would be a behaviour risk taken for cosmetics. Read the
# numbers, not the file order. All three workflows share project_dir/logs, so
# the leading digit keeps them disambiguated and globally sortable.
#
# DO NOT RENUMBER TO INSERT A RULE. Use a letter suffix (1.09b) until the next
# deliberate sweep — renumbering is a migration, not an edit.
# Convention: dev/reference/naming.md §9; full map:
# dev/reference/workflows/rule-index.md § What changed.

# --- log layout ---------------------------------------------------------------
# EVERY WF1 rule that logs writes a PART under logs/_parts/, and rule 1.17 merges
# the parts into ONE logs/wf1_build_model.log, then deletes them. So the only
# WF1 file left in logs/ after a full run is that merged log — matching WF2 (2.09)
# and WF3 (3.18), and the deal benchmarks/wf1_benchmarks.md already had.
#
# LOG_RULES is the merge order: rule LABELS, not part paths. merge_logs lists each
# label's part dir to find its members, so a fan-out width lives only in the rule
# that owns it (WF1 has no fan-out today; WF3 does). Naming the labels rather than
# globbing `_parts/` keeps an orphan dir from a renamed rule out of the file.
#
# ORDER IS BY RULE NUMBER, and since [R10-5] that is also dependency order, so
# the merged log reads as the workflow does. tests/test_log_rules_contract.py
# asserts it — the assertion was deferred until the renumber precisely because
# before it, number order and execution order disagreed and nobody had ruled on
# which the list should follow.
#
# 1.01 snapshot_config declares no `log:` and so has no section, and neither
# gather rule does. No entry for the merged-away forcing-recipe rule: [R10-1]
# folded it into 1.10, so its label has no producer, and an orphan label
# contributes an empty "no part from this run" section forever.
#
# The region rule was MISSING from this list until 2026-08-04, the first of four
# instances of one defect. It declares a `log:` part like every other rule here,
# but an unlisted label is not an error: merge_logs only looks up the labels it
# is given, so the section was silently absent from every merged log and its
# part was stranded under logs/_parts/ on every run. The benchmark gather does
# not share that failure mode -- wf1_benchmarks.md listed it all along -- which
# is why the two disagreed. That whole class is now mechanically checked, in
# both directions, for all three workflows.
#
# A `]` inside this block is fine again. It was not: test_model_reference.py
# sliced the list to the first one anywhere, so a bracketed followups reference
# truncated the label set it read. That parser is gone ([R10-10]), and the one
# that replaced it anchors the closing bracket at column 0.

#    via setup_outlets/setup_gauges and filters it out of the basin-average
#    setup (setup_gauges_and_outputs.py, `extras`).
#  - "precipitation" DOES get a column, and the rule drops it before plotting
#    (plot_results.py, `drop_vars("precipitation_basavg")`), so the figure is
#    never written. The SCRIPT keeps its name -- R10 renamed rule identifiers,
#    not modules.
# The filename is the CSV column name verbatim (func_plot_signature.plot_basavg
# writes f"{dvar}.png"), which is why it carries the config's spelling, spaces

# reach a derived table because both carry a numeric id:
#
# * `Q` on the `outlets` map (plus the `gauges_locations` map when the project
#   has a location registry) -- declared UNCONDITIONALLY by
#   setup_gauges_and_outputs, i.e. even when `river discharge` is absent from
#   `wflow_outvars`, so `output_q.csv` is always produced;
# * one SHORT CODE per remaining `wflow_outvars` entry, on the `subcatchment`
#   map with a mean reducer -- `gwr_101`.
#
# That second kind is why this list has to exist. 1.14b used to declare
# `output_q.csv` alone, on the reasoning that extras were `<var>_basavg` and so
# carried no id to key on. True once; the short-code change (shared/
# wflow_outputs.CODES) renamed them to `<code>_<subcatchment_id>`, which
# `tidy_wflow_table.split_columns` matches exactly as it matches a gauge
# column. So `write_tidy_tables` wrote `output_gwr.csv` -- and PRUNED it on a
# later run -- while no rule declared it. Undeclared output is invisible to
# Snakemake: nothing rebuilds it when deleted, and since rule 1.14's

# `Q_<id>` columns in wflow's internal order, full float precision — is an
# interface with that reader and stays untouched (AGENTS.md: do not
# re-engineer how hydromt handles data). The tables here are a product beside
# it: 5 decimal places, plain decimal (no `9.86e-5` for Excel to render as
# `9.87E-05`), date-only `YYYY-MM-DD` stamps, and bare station ids sorted
# numerically.
#
# Date-only rather than the `2000-01-02 00:00:00` this shipped with until
# 2026-08-10: that form parses as a DATETIME, which Excel then re-renders in
# the reader's locale, so one file read as `02-01-2000 00:00` on another
# machine. Dropping a time-of-day that is always midnight removes what the
# locale had to reformat.
#
# Being a product is also what makes the per-variable split safe. The variable
# moves into the FILENAME, which is what lets a column be `1010` rather than
# `Q_1010` without reviving the ambiguity `shared/gauges.py` exists to prevent.

   # contributing only the extra gauge stations on top. The signatures sheets

   # A directory() rather than a checkpoint, following WF0's `subbasins/` bin,

   # consumes — no rule reads these PNGs (figures are terminal artifacts), so

   # completeness, and declaring the bin buys that outright.

   # `--delete-all-output` completeness now holds for configs WITH extra gauges

# 1.17  gather_logs — merge every WF1 log part into ONE workflow log.
#
# Same rule as WF2's 2.09 and WF3's 3.18, against the same script; only the label
# list, the parts dir and the output name differ. `input:` is WF1_TERMINALS, the
# same set gather_benchmarks takes, which is what schedules it LAST: every
# logging rule is upstream of it. The parts stay in `params:` — they are
# `log:` files, and Snakemake does not track those in the DAG, so naming them as
# `input:` would demand them as buildable targets.
#
# The merge DELETES the parts it consumed and prunes the emptied dirs, so a clean
# full run leaves no logs/_parts/ at all. After a PARTIAL re-run only the re-run
# rules have parts, so the rewritten log marks the rest "no part from this run" —
# the same trade `merge_benchmarks` makes (dev/followups-archive.md R7-9).

# --- Run journal (design §5.7) ------------------------------------------------
#
# Emitted from WORKFLOW-LEVEL HANDLERS, never from a rule: a rule that is up to
# date does not execute, so it cannot record an invocation, and a rule that
# DECLARED the journal would have it deleted before the job ran -- Snakemake
# removes declared outputs first, truncating the ledger to one line every run,
# silently. A one-line journal looks exactly like a young one.
#
# SCOPE (R5 as narrowed 2026-08-13, after the P0 probe): these handlers cover
# invocations in which at least one job executed. On Snakemake 9.6.2 a "Nothing
# to be done" no-op fires NONE of them -- workflow.py:1375-1377 returns before
# _onstart, guarded by no flag -- so the journal counts executed runs, and a gap
# in the dates means no work was done rather than that nobody looked. Do not add
# a parse-time or atexit emitter to reach past this; the owner ruled against it.
