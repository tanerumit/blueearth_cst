    subcatchment id (``Q_101``), which is not a wflow_id at all. The location
    registry closes the gap: every subbasin has exactly one PRIMARY location,
    and that location's ``wflow_id`` is what names the outlet.

    Two consequences worth stating, because both used to be defects:

    * A gauge sitting on a model outlet is now recognised as ONE point even when
      the two series carry different index values — 101 and 1010 are the same
      cell here. ``merge_outlet_and_gauge_series`` can only see the collision
      when the raw indices coincide, so a project with output_locations at its
      outlet drew that station's figures twice, under two names.
    * A series whose index resolves to nothing keeps its own index as the id and
      says so. Guessing would be worse: the figures would be named after
      something no other artifact of the run recognises.

    Outlet ids and user gauge ids share ONE namespace — both are values burned
    into wflow's output maps (``blueearth_cst/shared/gauges.py``, MIN_GAUGE_ID)
    — and the two sets overlap whenever a gauge sits on the basin outlet. That
    is not an exotic case: delineating the model as a subbasin at the outlet
    gauge (`region: {'subbasin': [x, y]}`) is the normal way to build one, and
    it makes the outlet's subcatchment id equal to that gauge's ``wflow_id``.

    The two series then carry the same ``index`` with DIFFERENT ``station_name``
    values — the synthetic ``wflow_1`` on the outlet side, the user's own name
    on the gauge side — and ``xr.merge`` refuses to reconcile a coordinate that
    disagrees ("conflicting values for variable 'station_name'", observed
    2026-08-02 on a real basin whose outlet gauge is id 101).

    The OUTLET series wins on a collision. Until 2026-08-10 that mattered for
    a filename — rule 1.15 declared ``hydro_wflow_1.png`` and every figure was
    written as ``<kind>_{station_name}.png``, so a user name winning on the
    first outlet traded a MergeError for a MissingOutputException. The figures
    are keyed by ``wflow_id`` now and nothing is declared, so the choice is no
    longer load-bearing; it stays because a merge needs a deterministic winner
    and nothing is lost by it — the colliding entries are the same model cell,
    so the two series hold the same discharge.

    This only sees a collision when the two INDEX values coincide. An outlet
    and a gauge on one cell can also carry different indices (101 and 1010 are
    the same point on the test fixture), and that case is caught downstream by
    ``resolve_stations``, which dedupes on the resolved ``wflow_id``.

    Analyse and plot wflow model performance for historical run.

    The model root is supplied by the RULE as ``model_dir``, not rebuilt here
    from ``project_dir``: where the model lives is the Snakefile's fact, and
    spelling it in both places is how the two drift (R9 P2 commit 1).
    Model results should include the discharge keys Q_outlets and, if gauges are
    provided, Q_gauges_{basename(gauges_locs)}.

    Per-subcatchment climate figures were removed 2026-08-09 (ADR 0006): the
    climate a reader wants is the map and series family under
    ``models/hydrology/wflow/forcing/plots/``, and drawing it twice from two
    code paths was the duplication that decision retires.


    Outputs:

    - plot of hydrographs at the outlet(s) and gauges_locs if provided. If wflow run is
      three years or less, only the daily hydrograph will be plotted. If wflow run is
      longer than three years, plots will also include the yearly hydrograph, the
      monthly average and hyddrographs for the wettest and driest years. If observations
      are available, they are added as well.
    - plot of signature plots if wflow run is longer than a year and if observations
      are available.
    - plot of basin average outputs (e.g. soil moisture, snow, etc.). The variables to
      include should have the postfix _basavg in the wflow output file.
    - compute performance metrics (daily and monthly KGE, NSE, NSElog, RMSE, MSE, Pbias,
      VE) if observations are available and if wflow run is longer than a year. Metrics
      are saved to a csv file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    project_dir : Path
        path to CST project directory
    model_dir : Union[Path, str], optional
        The wflow model root, passed by the rule. Defaults to the v10 location
        under ``project_dir`` when omitted, which is what a standalone call
        gets.
    observations_fn : Union[Path, str], optional
        Path to observations timeseries file, by default None
        Required columns: time, wflow_id IDs of the locations as in ``gauges_locs``.
        Separator is **;** and decimal is . -- deliberately different from
        ``gauges_locs`` below, which is comma-separated. Both are read with an
        explicit ``sep=``; see ``config/templates/README.md``.
    gauges_locs : Union[Path, str], optional
        Path to gauges/observations locations file, by default None
        Required columns: wflow_id, station_name, x, y.
        Values in wflow_id column should match column names in ``observations_fn``.
        Separator is , and decimal is .
    location_registry : Union[Path, str], optional
