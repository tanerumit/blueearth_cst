"""The POST-MIGRATION project-tree inventory (`build_project_tree_rules`).

`[R10-11]`: the R9 path map runs one way — pre-R9 paths to post-R9 ones — so a
tree in the layout R9 delivered matches none of its old-side patterns and
`tree-check` returned exit 1 on every CORRECT tree. The map was never wrong; it
was being asked about an era that has passed.

The inventory answers the question that outlives the migration: **does this tree
hold anything nobody declared?** That is the property that caught
`region.geojson` (R9 phase-1 F1a) and that ADR 0003 §8a's seam intermediate
needed a row for.

Two instruments here, and the second matters more than the first:

1. row-driven coverage — every shape a clean three-workflow run produces
   resolves as IDENTITY;
2. the NON-CATCH-ALL guard — an artifact nobody declared still resolves to
   UNMAPPED. Without it the report is empty by construction and the gate passes
   unconditionally, which is the hazard
   `test_a_catch_all_config_prefix_would_empty_the_report` demonstrates on the
   R9 map.
