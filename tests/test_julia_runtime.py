"""The Julia version pin must agree across every place that declares it.

Julia is not in the pixi env (AGENTS.md hard constraint) — it is juliaup-managed
and selected per invocation by a ``+<version>`` prefix, so nothing in the
toolchain makes the declarations agree on their own. Three files pin it
independently and a drift between them is silent until a run picks up the wrong
toolchain: the env gets instantiated at one version while the workflows run at
another.

``config/advanced_settings.yml`` (``runtime.julia_version``) is the human-facing
declaration and the only one the workflows read. ``pixi.toml`` and
``Manifest.toml`` cannot read YAML, so this module is what keeps them in step —
single-sourcing is not available here, and pretending otherwise would leave the
drift undetected.

``Project.toml``'s ``julia = "~1.11"`` compat bound is deliberately looser (a
range, and the reason for the range is documented there), so it is not compared
for equality — only checked for shape and coverage.
