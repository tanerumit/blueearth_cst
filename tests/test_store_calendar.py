"""Tests for recovering the model calendar from the store (A3, 5b prerequisite).

Background: our generated catalog requests ``preprocess: harmonise_dims``, whose
time branch converts a ``CFTimeIndex`` to a ``DatetimeIndex``. After that a
``noleap`` model is indistinguishable from ``proleptic_gregorian`` — and was in
fact being written out AS ``proleptic_gregorian``, with ``cst_calendar`` empty.
See ``dev/records/milestones/r08/2026-07-30_wf2-5b-calendar-blocker.md``.

These cover the pure parser. The network read that feeds it is exercised by the
workflow, not here.
