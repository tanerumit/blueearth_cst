# Task Brief — P7: documentation

### Context

`AGENTS.md` ("Keep configuration references current" — a stale path in a
document someone reads to do their job is a defect, not a record); design
`design-v3.md` §5.10. Depends on P4.

- `README.md` ~170–186 documents the bundle, its 12-hex directory naming, and
  `referenced-files.json` — all of which cease to exist.
- Per-bin `README.md` files are the house pattern (`config/defaults/`,
  `config/templates/`, `config/basemap/` each have one).
- The one genuine trap in the project tree: `project_config_model_creation.yml`
  sits under a directory called `config/`, looks exactly like a file you would
  edit and re-run, and editing it silently does nothing.

### Goal

Leave no document describing the removed bundle, and disarm the editability
trap where a reader meets it.

### Non-goals

No changes to `AGENTS.md`'s repo map beyond what the removal makes false. Not a
tutorial on provenance.

### Allowed scope

- **Permitted (`lane/devmeta`):** `README.md`, and a new
  `<project_dir>/config/runs/README.md` template shipped from the repo.
- **Forbidden:** `dev/` sealed records — check
  `dev/reference/sealed-records.yml` before editing anything under `dev/`; a
  document listed there is frozen and `tests/test_sealed_records.py` enforces it.

### Required changes (checklist)

1. Replace `README.md` ~170–186 with the new model: current-only
   `run_record.yml`, the journal, and the R4 copy rule.
2. New `config/runs/README.md`: "everything here is written by the run; edit the
   source config instead", naming `run_record.yml` as the projection-bearing
   artifact.
   **Must also state what the journal is a ledger OF** (design §5.7, R5 as
   narrowed 2026-08-13): **executed** invocations. A "Nothing to be done" run
   appends nothing, so the line count is an exact count of executions and a
   *lower bound* on invocations — a gap in the dates means no work was done,
   not that nobody ran the command. Stating this is the whole mitigation for
   the residual the owner accepted at design §7 item 11; leaving it implicit
   would let a reader over-read the file.
3. Grep the tree for surviving references to the removed names and fix every
   live one in the same commit:
   `grep -rn "referenced-files\|snapshot_bundle\|source\.yml\|effective\.yml"`
   across `README.md`, `docs/`, `AGENTS.md` and code comments.

### Validation

- Rung 1: `pytest tests/test_sealed_records.py` — proves no frozen record was
  edited.
- Rung 4: `pixi run test-fast`.

**Falsifier for "no live reference survives":** the grep in item 3 returning a
hit outside `dev/` milestone records and this task directory. Milestone records
under `dev/` are *deliberately* unedited history and are the expected hits —
distinguish them from live guidance rather than sweeping them.

### Acceptance criteria

Grep clean outside the historical-record exceptions; both READMEs accurate
against a freshly-run project tree.

### Task constraints

Do not update `dev/` milestone or review records to match the new design — they
are the baseline past work was checked against and are valuable *because* they
are unedited (`AGENTS.md`).
