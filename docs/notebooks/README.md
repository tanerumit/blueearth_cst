# Workflow notebooks

Three notebooks, one per workflow, meant to be read in order. Each names the
Snakefile it drives, walks the settings file that controls it, renders the job
graph, runs it, and then *reads* the results rather than only displaying them.

| # | Notebook | Workflow | What it covers |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [Model building](<Model building.ipynb>) | `build_model.smk` | Delineates the basin, extracts a historical climate store, builds and forces a Wflow-SBM model with hydromt, runs it once, and evaluates it against observed discharge. |
| 2 | [Climate projections](<Climate projections.ipynb>) | `analyze_projections.smk` | Fetches CMIP6 slices for the basin and derives monthly and annual change factors per model, scenario and horizon — the plausibility overlay, not a driver of the stress test. |
| 3 | [Climate stress test](<Climate Stress Test.ipynb>) | `run_stress_test.smk` | Generates stochastic weather realizations, perturbs them across a temperature × precipitation grid, runs Wflow for every combination, and reduces the result to a response surface. |

Run them in order. Notebook 3 does not rebuild the model — it binds to the one
notebook 1 left behind, and refuses to run against a stale build.

## Running them

The notebooks execute the real pipeline, so they need the toolbox installed, not
just a Python kernel:

```bash
pixi install       # Python stack, R toolchain, snakemake, graphviz
pixi run install   # + weathergenr (R) and the Julia environment
```

Julia is **not** in the pixi environment — it is juliaup-managed and must
already be on `PATH`. See `docs/install.md` if setup misbehaves.

Then start Jupyter (or VS Code) from inside that environment:

```bash
pixi run jupyter lab docs/notebooks
```

Every notebook locates the repository root itself by walking up from the
kernel's working directory, so it does not matter where you start it — there is
no install path to edit.

All three run against `test_case/project_config_rapid.yml`, the cheap
end-to-end config. To point one at your own project, change the `CONFIG`
constant in the setup cell; everything downstream is derived from the config.
For a new project, copy `config/templates/project_config.template.yml`.

Run the pipeline from the **primary checkout**, not from a task worktree.
Snakemake keeps its up-to-date metadata under the working directory, so one
project driven from two checkouts gets two stores that disagree, and each holds
its own lock while writing the same outputs.

## Outputs are NOT committed

Each notebook is committed as **source only**: every cell's outputs and
execution counts are cleared. Two mechanisms, and the split between them
matters:

- `dev/scripts/notebook_outputs.py --strip` clears them, and `--check` reports.
- `tests/test_notebook_outputs.py` is **the gate**, because it runs on both CI
  legs and on every checkout. The `.githooks/pre-commit` hook is the fast local
  echo of it, not the gate — `core.hooksPath` is a per-clone setting that
  cloning does not install, so a hook alone protects only the machines that
  opted in.

**This reverses the 2026-08-13 ruling** (fao assessment §6.3, option C: commit
outputs with a dated `rendered against <sha>` banner). What changed is the
measured cost. A notebook carrying figures embeds them as base64 PNG and so does
not delta-compress: every edit mints a fresh multi-megabyte blob that stays in
history forever. On 2026-08-14 `Model building.ipynb` was 6.43 MB with **82 blob
versions already in history**, and a rename sweep that rewrote three short
strings inside the three notebooks turned a few hundred KB of text change into a
**7.1 MB push**. Stripping took the set from 8.8 MB to 0.08 MB.

The ruling was buying something real, and it is not simply given up: the point
of committed outputs was that a reader sees the results without running the
pipeline (assessment §6.1 point 6 — *"they teach the reading of the output"*).
That is preserved by **publishing a rendered copy as an Artifact** instead of
committing it, which is option D from the same table. Render with the nbconvert
command below and publish the HTML; the repo keeps the source, the reader still
gets the figures.

Staleness moves with it. There is no longer a `<sha>` banner to trust or
distrust, because there are no committed numbers to be stale — the prose is the
only thing in the file, and it is kept current like any other document.

### Re-rendering

From the primary checkout, on a commit that already carries the prose you want
rendered:

```bash
pixi run jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --inplace \
  --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=3600 "docs/notebooks/Model building.ipynb"
```

`--inplace` writes the outputs back into the **tracked** file, which is exactly
what must not be committed. So publish the rendered result as an Artifact, then
strip the notebook again before committing:

```bash
pixi run python dev/scripts/notebook_outputs.py --strip
```

The pre-commit hook catches it if you forget; `tests/test_notebook_outputs.py`
catches it if the hook is not installed.

Two things to know before you run it:

- A run against an already up-to-date project reports "nothing to be done", so
  the run cells render empty of work. Deleting the terminal outputs first — the
  `plots/` directories, `performance_metrics.csv`, `experiments/*/results/` —
  makes those rules re-execute without redoing the model build or the CMIP6
  fetches.
- Deleting `performance_metrics.csv` re-runs Wflow. Rule 1.15's input is
  `run_default/output.csv`, which rule 1.14 declares as `temp()`, so a completed
  run has already removed it. That is expected, not a cascade bug.

Verify by checking the executed notebooks rather than by reading them, on four
counts:

- no cell carries an `error` output;
- no cell's captured text contains `Error in rule` or `Exiting because a job
  execution failed`;
- every code cell has an execution count, so none was skipped; and
- every cell that asks for an image carries an `image/png` payload — 5 in
  *Model building*, 4 in *Climate projections*, 2 in *Climate Stress Test*.

The last two are what catch a cell that ran and produced nothing. `nbconvert`
exiting 0 proves only that no Python exception escaped a cell, and the `run()`
helper returns the subprocess exit code with nothing acting on it, so a failed
Snakemake call inside a notebook otherwise reads as a successful cell.

To read a rendered notebook as a web page. Pass `--output-dir`, or nbconvert
writes a ~7 MB untracked `.html` beside the notebook, inside the tracked
`docs/notebooks/`:

```bash
pixi run jupyter nbconvert --to html --embed-images \
  --output-dir .tmp/notebooks-html "docs/notebooks/<name>.ipynb"
```

Add `--template basic` for a fragment with no external references at all; the
default template pulls MathJax, mermaid and require.js from a CDN, which is
harmless in a browser but not offline-clean.

## Data

The rapid config builds a small test basin from global datasets, registered in
`config/catalogs/deltares_data.yml` (physiography, land surface, climate) and
`config/catalogs/cmip6_data.yml` (projections, generated from a live listing of
the public CMIP6 store).

Sources are never hardcoded in a rule: they are named in a catalog and handed to
hydromt with `-d`, so retargeting a project at different inputs is a config
edit. The table below is what the *default* configuration uses; a specific run's
inputs are whatever its config named, and the catalog entry is the authoritative
citation.

Which land-cover, LAI and soil products a run actually used is set by
`shared.basin.spatial_sources.{lulc,lai,soil}`; the waterbody sources come from
`config/defaults/wflow_update_waterbodies.yml`.

*The basin, the model and the results in these notebooks are for illustration.
This is a rapid, uncalibrated, global-data deployment — see notebook 1's
evaluation section for what that means when reading the numbers.*
