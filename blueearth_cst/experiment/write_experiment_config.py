"""Record an experiment's own configuration, and freeze it once it has run.

R9 P4 commit 4. ``experiments/<id>/config/experiment.yml`` holds the experiment
id and the resolved ``workflows.run_stress_test`` section — the parameters
that define *this* experiment, beside the ``model_reference.yml`` that records
which model it used.

Generated, not authored. A hand-written file here would be a second source of
truth competing with the ``--configfile``, which is the
``config/project.yml`` direction the R9 master brief puts out of scope. Being
generated also means it always matches what actually ran.

**Immutable at the FIRST SUCCESSFUL RUN, not at creation.** Editing an
experiment's parameters before it has produced anything is ordinary work; doing
so afterwards would silently redefine what the existing results mean. Freezing
at creation would be a different and worse feature — it would forbid the legal
case to make the illegal one easy.

The marker for "has run successfully" is the merged workflow log. It is written
by the last rule in WF3 and is one of ``rule all``'s targets, so it exists only
after a complete run: a run that failed midway never reaches the merge. The
marker is read from the filesystem rather than declared as an input, because
declaring it would invert the DAG — this file is written long before the log.

**The marker PATH is passed in, never rebuilt here.** It used to be a module
constant joined onto ``exp_dir``, which the 2026-08-11 move of WF3's run records
to ``{project_dir}/logs/wf3_run_stress_test_<experiment>.log`` invalidated:
the log is no longer under the experiment at all. A marker path this module
composes for itself is a second spelling of a name the Snakefile owns, and when
the two drift the failure is SILENT — ``has_run_successfully`` returns ``False``
forever and the freeze guard stops firing, which is the one thing this module
exists to do. Rule 3.07 hands over the same string rule 3.18 declares as its
``output:``.

    Two events reach this comparison and they are not the same thing:

    * **the user changed a setting** — ``simulation_window.end: 2054 → 2090``.
      The results really are redefined and the freeze must refuse;
    * **the toolbox changed which settings EXIST** — a key retired between
      releases. The user changed nothing, and whether the results are redefined
      depends entirely on what the retirement did.

    Until 2026-08-12 they were indistinguishable: the comparison is a key-union
    diff, so a key present in the record and absent from the config reads as
    changed, and every already-run experiment refused after any such retirement
    (`t2608072234`). That was ruled per-milestone twice — correctly for
    ``aggregate_rlz``, whose removal changed the table's GRAIN, and wrongly for
    ``Tpeak``/``Tlow``, which were value-preserving.

    So the second event is now resolved by DECLARATION rather than inference:
    ``indicator_tables.RETIRED_EXPERIMENT_KEYS`` records, per retired key,
    whether existing results still mean what they did. Only whoever retires the
    key knows that, which is why it cannot be worked out here.

    **An unregistered key still counts as changed.** Forgetting to register a
    retirement must fail loud rather than silently unfreeze every experiment in
    the project — the same default, and the same reasoning, as
    ``refuse_retired_experiment_keys``.
