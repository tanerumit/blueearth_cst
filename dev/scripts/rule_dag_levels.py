"""Print a Snakefile's rules in DAG (topological) order, with job counts.

Snakemake's own ``Job stats:`` table is sorted **alphabetically** and no flag
changes that (checked against snakemake 9.6.2), so it tells you what will run but
never what runs *before* what. This helper re-sorts the same information by
dependency depth.

Two non-executing snakemake calls do the work:

* ``--rulegraph dot`` — the rule-level dependency graph. Carries **every** rule
  the workflow defines, including ones with nothing left to do.
* ``--dag dot`` — the job-level graph. Read only to count jobs per rule and to
  separate the ones that will run from the ones already up to date (snakemake
  draws the latter ``style="rounded,dashed"``).

Both are read as **DOT**, never as ``--d3dag``: on 9.6.2 the D3 JSON silently
drops edges — 48 of them against the DOT graph's 73 for the same WF2 DAG — so a
level computed from it would be quietly wrong rather than merely uglier.
``--rulegraph mermaid-js`` is broken in the same version (emits self-edges and
mismatched pairs); ``dot`` is the only trustworthy renderer of the three.

The level is the **longest** path from a source, which makes it a lower bound on
the number of sequential stages: no ``--cores`` setting can start level *N*
before level *N-1* has finished. Rules sharing a level are mutually independent,
so that is where extra cores actually go.

What a level is **not** is a schedule. Snakemake starts a job the moment its own
inputs exist, not level by level, so independent chains overlap — one series can
be in ``reduce_gcm_series`` while another is still in ``fetch_gcm_slice``. Read the
levels as dependency depth, never as "these run together and nothing else does".

Usage (from the repo root, inside pixi)::

    python dev/scripts/rule_dag_levels.py -s analyze_projections.smk \\
        --configfile test_case/project_config_baseline.yml

    # anything after `--` is forwarded to snakemake verbatim
    python dev/scripts/rule_dag_levels.py -s build_model.smk \\
        --configfile <cfg> -- --config project_dir=/tmp/probe

Not part of a run: this inspects a workflow, it never executes one
(see AGENTS.md, "Three homes for executables").
