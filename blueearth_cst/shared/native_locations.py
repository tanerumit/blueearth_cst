"""Label every Wflow CSV column with the location registry's ``wflow_id``.

Wflow names a mapped column ``<header>_<map value>``, and the map decides what
the value means. A gauge map burns in the ``wflow_id`` itself (``Q_1010``); the
``outlets`` and ``subcatchment`` maps burn in the SUBBASIN id (``Q_101``,
``aet_101``). One run's results therefore spoke three id spaces at once -- q on
101, 1020, 1030, 1040 and aet/gwr on 101..104, beside WF1 figures keyed
1010..1040 (t2609251515).

Every derived result is keyed by ``wflow_id`` instead:

* a column on a gauge map keeps its value, already a ``wflow_id``;
* a column on the outlets or an area map takes its subbasin's PRIMARY
  ``wflow_id``, the one ``plot_results.resolve_stations`` names the outlet by;
* two point columns on one model cell -- a gauge snapped onto the outlet -- are
  one series, and the GAUGE is kept, since its id is already the label; so is
  an outlet whose primary gauge sits a cell off it, being that gauge's point.

The subbasin -> primary crosswalk is read from the model's own gauge layer
(``staticgeoms/<map>.geojson``), which WF1 writes from the location registry in
the same build as ``staticmaps.nc``. ``staticgeoms/`` is outside the model
digest, so every crosswalk ``wflow_id`` is checked against the digested gauge
map before it is trusted. A model without that layer, or whose layer lacks the
registry columns, keeps its native ids. The native CSVs are never rewritten.
