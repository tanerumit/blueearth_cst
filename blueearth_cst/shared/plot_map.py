"""The wflow basin map: read a model off disk and draw its DEM (rule 1.11).

Created 2022-01-13 (@author: bouaziz); refactored in R3 into a guarded
function; rebuilt in 2026-08 as a publication-grade figure; reduced in 2026-08
to what is actually wflow-specific once the cartography moved to
``shared.cartographic_map``.

What is left here is the reading half and one style choice:

* ``load_basin_layers`` opens a model's own files directly — ``xarray`` for
  ``staticmaps.nc``, ``geopandas`` for ``staticgeoms/*.geojson`` — so the whole
  render path imports neither ``hydromt`` nor ``hydromt_wflow``, and anyone
  holding those two artifacts can draw the figure.
* ``plot_basin_map`` calls the template with the elevation style, which is the
  only one that asks for a hillshade and the only one kept on a LINEAR scale:
  elevation is the quantity a reader does arithmetic on.
* ``plot_basin_map_from_model`` resolves a model directory into layers and
  writes ``basin_area.{pdf,png}``. This is what the Snakemake rule runs.

Verified equivalent before the hydromt drop, not assumed: rendering the same
model through ``WflowSbmModel`` and through the files produced byte-identical
images (0 differing pixels of 3,754,080).

What is genuinely given up: ``mod.rivers`` and ``mod.basins`` are FALLBACK
properties (``hydromt_wflow/wflow_base.py``), reconstructing the network from
the flow-direction raster via ``pyflwdir`` when the geojson is absent. A model
whose ``staticgeoms/`` lacks them raises instead of being rebuilt — a
deliberate trade, and the reason ``load_basin_layers`` names the missing layers
rather than failing obscurely downstream.
