    # so a `setup_config` entry in that template would fail the build. This also
    # reaches WF3 for free -- `downscale_climate_forcing.py` opens THIS model
    # root with `mode="r+"` and layers per-member deltas onto its TOML, so every
    # member inherits `[logging] silent` and only overrides `path_log`.

    # WF3 is where the console cost actually is: rule 3.15 batches members
    # concurrently through one `run_logged` tee, so N members interleave their
    # Julia records into a single stream that attributes none of them. The
    # per-member `path_log` files are the attribution mechanism and are
    # untouched by this.
    #
    # NOT a performance change. P33 probe 1b measured `silent=true` against
    # production `loglevel="info"` and found run2/run3 unchanged at 35-36 s --
    # logging is not a per-run cost on this basin, which is why P33 dropped
    # `loglevel` as a speed lever. This is a console-readability change only.

    # DOTTED, not nested, and the difference is load-bearing. `setup_config`
