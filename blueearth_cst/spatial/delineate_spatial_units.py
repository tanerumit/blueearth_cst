"""Delineate the shared vector foundation once per project (ADR 0003 §8).

Rule ``delineate_subbasins_and_rivers``'s script — the SINGLE producer of
``spatial/geoms/{basins,subbasins,catchments,rivers,locations}.geojson``,
``spatial/location_registry.csv`` and the hydrography grid seam, declared
identically in all three workflows (``1.01c`` / ``2.03c`` / ``3.01f``) from
``snake_utils.spatial_units_rule``.

Before this split the layers were by-products of rule 1.01, whose real product
is ``spatial_maps.nc`` and the thematic raster stack behind it. WF2 and WF3
want basin and subbasin boundaries for figures and metrics; declaring the
unsplit rule would have made a projections-only run resample ``vito``,
``modis_lai`` and ``soilgrids`` to draw a subbasin outline — the same trade
ADR 0003 exists to have removed, one level down. Measured 2026-08-06, the split
avoids ~71% of what the unsplit alternative would add.

Model-free by construction, the property R07 B1 bought and this must not spend:
the inputs are the data catalog, the shared region polygon, and the optional
gauge-point file. Nothing here reads a built model.

    Every keyword is a ``shared.basin`` field resolved by

    one because ADR 0003 §8b requires the rule's params to be a pure function
    of ``project`` + ``shared.basin``. In particular the deprecated
    ``workflows.build_model.output_locations`` fallback CANNOT feed this
    rule: the five projections-only configs carry no ``workflows.build_model``
    section at all, so a params payload that depended on one would differ per
    invoking workflow — the input/params asymmetry ``ext1-02`` forbade for the
