"""One table describing each configurable wflow output.

Three things used to be keyed off a wflow output variable, in three places:

* its CSDMS name, for the TOML (``model/setup_gauges_and_outputs.WFLOW_VARS``);
* its resample rule and axis legend, for the figures
  (``shared/func_plot_signature.WFLOW_VARS``);
* its COLUMN NAME in ``output.csv``, which was the semantic label with
  ``_basavg`` glued on -- so a config asking for ``groundwater recharge``
  produced ``groundwater recharge_basavg_101``. Spaces in a column name, 32
  characters before the id, and a figure filename to match.

They are one table here, keyed by a short CODE. The code is what reaches the
csv, so the column is ``gwr_101``; the semantic label stays the config spelling,
because that is what a user writes in ``wflow_outvars``.

**The code is a contract.** It appears in ``output.csv`` headers, in the
variables hydromt derives from them (``<code>_subcatchment``), in the derived
tables from rule 1.14, and in figure filenames. Changing one renames all four.

Discharge is deliberately absent from ``CODES``: it does not travel the
basin-average path at all. It is emitted per-gauge and per-outlet with the fixed
header ``Q``, which ``shared/gauges.py`` keys on.
