"""Unit cases for the response-surface axis derivation (HM-7).

**This is the only gate `shared/surface_axes.py` has.** No rule in the repo
calls it: the consumers that draw a surface are out-of-repo and re-implement
from the contract text. Under this repo's own ladder — "only the tests covering
the file you changed" — an unnamed test file is an ungated file, and this is the
largest new surface in the design.

The collapse cases inherited from `test_export_wflow_results.py` carry a load
the rest of the ladder cannot: every tracked config uses a FLAT monthly
perturbation vector, so the baseline manifest and every fixture run are blind to
the collapse by construction. A seasonal vector is the only input that can tell
reading January apart from taking the annual mean, and nothing on disk supplies
one.
