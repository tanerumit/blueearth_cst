"""Keep a failed Wflow batch's finished members, so a retry re-runs only the failures.

Rule 4.05 runs several members in one Julia session. Snakemake treats the batch
as one job, so when one member fails it deletes every declared output of that
job -- the finished siblings included -- and a retry reruns all of them.

The driver (``run_wflow_batch.jl``) therefore MOVES each member's CSV out of
the declared path into this staging directory the moment the member succeeds,
then turns its ``.expect`` marker into ``.ok``. Moving it at once, rather than
in a Python post-pass, is what keeps it safe when the process dies outright:
Snakemake's cleanup only knows the declared paths.

Staging is keyed by RUN ID, not batch index, because batch membership is not
stable across attempts: ``resolve_batch_size`` depends on ``--cores``, the
Julia thread count and disk headroom. A staged member is reused only when its
marker records the same TOML digest and frozen-simulation digest the retry
would run with; anything else is discarded and re-run.

Not covered: the failing member's own partial output is still cleaned, so that
member always re-runs -- which is the point.
