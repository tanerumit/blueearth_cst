# Changelog

Personal fork of `Deltares/blueearth_cst`. Release history follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) loosely.

Releases follow the [manual toolbox versioning policy](dev/reference/versioning.md):
Git release tags are authoritative; milestone tags are development checkpoints.
Milestone detail lives in `dev/roadmap.md` and `dev/records/milestones/`.

## [Unreleased]

### Breaking

- Scenario-collection, simulation and metric-set ids all change. Each identity
  hashes the repository code its stage imports, and removing the pre-release v1
  records edited shared modules on all three paths; the relocation fix below
  moves the metric-set id once more. The climate-store identity does not change. Existing collections, experiments and metric sets stay
  readable, but none is reused by a fresh run:
  - WF3 generates a new collection instead of reusing the retained one.
  - Re-simulating an existing experiment is refused; use a new experiment name.
  - A metrics-only run over a retained experiment publishes a new metric set
    with identical values.

### Added

- Each metric set retains its return-level evidence as
  `_engine/metric_sets/<id>/return_level_evidence.json`, SHA-referenced from
  the manifest and verified on read. For every fitted return level it records
  the usable block counts per member against the required minimum, the fitted
  parameters, fit and shape coverage, and the policies applied. Sets published
  without it stay readable.

### Changed

- WF2 reads the public CMIP6 bucket anonymously. With no token, each fetch
  process spent about 19 s searching for Google credentials first.
- The metric-set reader accepts only `metrics.json` as a set's engine marker.

### Fixed

- A project tree copied to another root reuses its ready scenario collection,
  simulation and metric set instead of refusing them. The installed
  weather-generator input and each metric plan record absolute paths under
  the original root, and reuse compared those paths against the new root.

### Removed

- The v1 -> v2 project-config migrator (`scripts/migrate_project_config.py`),
  its mapping (`config/migrations/v1_to_v2.yml`) and its guide. Migrate a
  pre-R14 project config with release `v0.3.0`, which still ships all three; the
  loader's refusals now say so. `ruamel.yaml` is no longer a declared dependency.
- Support for the pre-release v1 records: the `config/simulation.json`
  simulation record, the v1 response inventory, `scenario-collection/1`, and
  `metric-set/1`. No release wrote them; they existed only between 2026-09-11
  and 2026-09-22. Such an experiment is now refused by name; simulate it again
  under a new experiment name.

## [v0.3.0] — 2026-10-01

Pre-1.0 minor release with incompatible user interfaces, output contracts,
and scientific calculations since `v0.2.0-alpha`. This entry is prepared for
release; the authoritative version is established only by the approved Git tag.

### Breaking

- Reorganized the shipped code into `blueearth_cst/`, consolidated configuration
  and project output layouts, and renamed workflow rules. Existing scripts,
  rule targets, and output consumers need migration.
- Split project configuration into a project file and per-workflow files, with
  closed workflow stanzas and shared keys owned by the project file's `basin`,
  `climate`, and `model` sections or top level. See the
  [project-config migration guide](docs/site/guide/migrating-project-config.qmd).
- Reworked projections analysis around monthly GCM series. `save_grids` became
  `save_gridded`; variable declarations now specify canonical names and change
  semantics. Missing catalog models fail at DAG construction; unavailable
  scenario/member combinations are reported as skips. See the
  [R8 migration record](dev/records/milestones/r08/migration-wf2.md).
- Separated scenario generation (WF3) from system simulation and retained-response
  metrics (WF4). Scenario collections, explicit run IDs, immutable metric sets,
  and their output contracts replace the predecessor experiment layout. Use the
  owned workflow runners described in [README.md](README.md).
- Result locations now use the registry `wflow_id`; the baseline outlet changed
  from `101` to `1010`. Consumers must use registry identifiers.

### Added

- Model-independent historical climate analysis (WF0), forcing-readiness
  reporting, model interchange contracts, and expanded practitioner documentation.
- Projection annual and monthly change-factor tables, requested-combination
  status reporting, provenance and limitation reports, and reusable series
  caching with separate fetch and reduction steps.
- Durable scenario collections with generation-code identity, simulation batch
  recovery, batching calibration, and retained-response metric validation.
- Cross-platform CI, focused validation gates, and the manual toolbox release
  policy and checklist.
- A single-workflow selector (`scripts/run_workflow.py`) for all five workflows,
  delegating generation and simulation to their owned runners; external basin
  case scaffolding through `scripts/create_case.py`.

### Changed

- Projection spatial means use spherical cell-area weights; annual aggregation
  uses month lengths in each model's calendar. Reduction no longer rounds to
  two decimals; default statistics are mean, median, and standard deviation,
  with labelled, opt-in tail quantiles. Figures show individual combinations.
- Scenario identity follows generation code; downstream simulation changes do
  not invalidate generation. Simulation retains one discharge series per model
  cell and stages completed batch members for reuse after interruption.
- WF3 generation-input snapshots now live under the scenario collection's
  `_engine` directory.

### Fixed

- Projection reference windows include the final complete hydrological year
  (`1990–2010` includes 21 years). Model calendars are read from their stores,
  and reduction-kernel identity now invalidates stale cached arithmetic.
- The unperturbed scenario now passes through the same perturbation step as
  other scenarios. In the recorded baseline, affected low-flow results decreased
  by up to about 90%; the accepted baseline was re-recorded on 2026-09-25.
  See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for baseline configuration and provenance.
- Restored workflow log and benchmark gathering, corrected checkpoint lookups,
  and repaired Windows console capture during simulation preparation.
- Serialized netCDF access during staging to avoid the observed lock-order
  stall, and corrected projection flagged-month dataset identities.

### Migration

- Migrate older project configuration with
  `pixi run python scripts/migrate_project_config.py <project-file> --dry-run`,
  review the proposed changes, then run without `--dry-run`. See the
  [current migration guide](docs/site/guide/migrating-project-config.qmd) for
  backup behavior and cases the migrator refuses.
- Update workflow commands using [README.md](README.md), and update consumers
  against the [current output structure](docs/site/guide/outputs.qmd).
  Configuration migration alone does not migrate predecessor output trees;
  retain the old tree and regenerate into a separate project directory.
- Recompute affected projections and scenario/simulation results under the
  current contracts. Changes to weighting, calendars, reference windows, and
  baseline perturbation mean numerical parity with the preceding release is
  not expected. The measured low-flow change above describes the recorded
  baseline, not a bound for other basins.

### Known limitations

- Docker and Linux end-to-end scientific replication remain unqualified;
  cross-platform CI does not establish full-pipeline numerical equivalence.
- A portable sample-data bundle is not shipped. Existing seed catalogs can
  depend on machine-specific data locations; configure accessible data before
  running a new basin. See [installation](docs/site/setup/install.md).
- WF0 provides historical characterization and forcing-readiness reporting;
  the planned forcing-selection evaluation layer remains future work.

## [v0.2.0-alpha] — 2026-05-09

Foundation phase sealed; Phase 2 (workflow refactor) designed and
ready to execute. Substantial change since `v0.1.0-alpha` — minor
version bump reflects breaking library upgrades plus structural and
testing additions that make Phase 2 possible.

### Phase 1 (Foundation, sealed)

- **M01 — Replication baseline** (`m01-replication`): all three
  Snakemake workflows replicated end-to-end on the test config;
  baseline manifest at `dev/baseline/manifest.json`;
  `dev/scripts/check_baseline.py` with `record` / `check` subcommands.
- **M02 — Pixi env** (`m02-pixi`): pixi-driven Python + R + Julia env
  replacing conda + ad-hoc setup. Single declarative `pixi.toml`.
- **M02b — Library upgrades** (`m02b-upgrades`): hydromt 0.x → 1.3,
  hydromt_wflow 0.x → 1.0.2, Wflow.jl 0.7 → 1.0.2, Python stack caps
  lifted (numpy 2.x, xarray latest). Baseline re-recorded under the
  "intentional drift, document deltas" policy.
- **M02c — Test coverage** (`m02c-tests`): 32 new unit tests across 4
  `src/` modules plus 2 strict xfails for documented bugs (hydromt
  `to_yml` preprocess strip; `extract_climate_grid` silent truncation).
  Established the `sys.modules.setdefault` mocking pattern.

### Phase 2 (Refactor) — designed, not yet executed

- **R1 design** (`dev/records/milestones/r01/`): per-workflow modularity contracts.
  Sectioned config schema (`project` / `shared` / `workflows.<name>`),
  per-workflow contract docs, atomic migration plan including
  `src/` script updates and baseline-snapshot policy.
- **R2 design** (`dev/records/milestones/r02/`): prescriptive naming conventions style
  guide (snake_case, lowercase acronyms, `_path` canonical, suffix
  vocabulary split between paths and data objects, domain-identifier
  escape hatch, "do not rename without migration note" surfaces).

### Toolchain

- **Python 3.12 → 3.14.4**. The deprecated `Path(fn, resolve_path=True)`
  kwarg in `src/prepare_climate_data_catalog.py` was fixed (closes
  R3 followup early as prep for the cap bump).
- **Snakemake stays at 9.6.2**. Bump to 9.20 deferred — snakemake 9.7+
  requires `packaging<26` but the conda env pulls in `packaging==26.2`
  via another dep. Likely fixed in snakemake 9.21+.
- `datrie` pin removed (was redundant; modern snakemake doesn't need it
  as a hard conda dep).

### Repo structure

- Roadmap restructured into Phase 1 (sealed) / Phase 2 (active)
  sections with clear visual break.
- `dev/records/milestones/phase-1/{m01,m02,m02b,m02c}/` for sealed foundation milestones.
- `dev/records/milestones/r01/`, `dev/records/milestones/r02/` for active Phase 2 milestones.
- `dev/reference/` reserved for R2 output.
- Stale forward-looking M3-M6 references renamed to R3-R6 across docs,
  tests, and code comments.
- New tag prefix convention: `r##-<topic>` for Phase 2 (e.g.
  `r03-model-builder`); `m##-<topic>` preserved for sealed Phase 1.

### Testing

- Suite total: 45 passed, 4 xfailed. Unchanged through the entire
  toolchain bump and repo restructure (validates that the moves and
  text updates don't affect runtime behavior).

### Documentation

- README updated to reflect fork status, Python 3.14, Julia 1.11.x via
  juliaup, deferred Docker, and pointers to `dev/install.md` and
  `dev/roadmap.md`.
- New `CHANGELOG.md` (this file).

### Known issues / followups

- Test `xfail`s tracked in `dev/tasks/`:
  - hydromt `to_yml` preprocess strip — upstream hydromt issue.
  - `extract_climate_grid` silent truncation when staged source < requested window — fix in R3.
- Snakemake bump to 9.20 deferred until upstream relaxes the
  `packaging<26` constraint.
- Linux / Docker validation deferred (see "Deferred: Linux replication"
  in `dev/roadmap.md`).

## [v0.1.0-alpha] — base

Upstream starting point. Forked from `Deltares/blueearth_cst` at this
version. Branch `base/v0.1.0-alpha` preserves the exact starting
commit. All Phase 1 work in this fork builds on top of this baseline.
