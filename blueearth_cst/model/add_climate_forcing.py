"""Assemble the hydromt forcing recipe and apply it — rules 1.06 + 1.08, merged.

`dev/followups-archive.md` `[R10-1]`. Rule 1.06 wrote a `steps:` YAML whose **only**
consumer was rule 1.07, which ran `hydromt update wflow_sbm -i` against it. Two
rules, one job — and a recipe that never leaves the pair needs no rule name of
its own, which is why 1.07's R10 rename was withdrawn rather than replaced.

**Why a `script:` and not a `shell:`.** Snakemake allows one of the two per rule,
and the halves were one of each. Driving hydromt's CLI from Python keeps the
command byte-identical to what rule 1.07 issued, which is what makes this merge
behaviour-preserving; calling hydromt's Python API instead would have been a
second change wearing the same commit.

**Why the output is streamed rather than inherited.** `tee_to_log` redirects
``sys.stdout``/``sys.stderr`` at the Python level — it does not touch a child
process's file descriptors. A bare ``subprocess.run`` inheriting stdout would
therefore write hydromt's ``-vv`` output to the console and leave the rule's log
part empty, silently losing what the `shell:` rule used to capture through
``run_logged``. Reading the pipe and re-printing puts it back inside the tee, and
line-by-line so a long update stays visible while it runs. The pipe is decoded
with ``newline=""`` and re-emitted one ``sys.stdout.write`` per line, both
load-bearing: universal newlines would explode hydromt's carriage-return
progress bar into a row per frame, and ``print`` splits text from newline into
two writes, which is a partial chunk the tee's console mute refuses to match.

The recipe builder itself is untouched and still lives in
`blueearth_cst/shared/setup_time_horizon.py`, with `tests/test_setup_time_horizon.py`
covering it directly — the merge moves the *invocation*, not the logic.

    * **Below ``MIN_HISTORICAL_YEARS``** (``require_min_years``). The extraction

      winning candidate costs no re-extraction. That reuse is the point; an
