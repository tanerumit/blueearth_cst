"""Stage a bbox subset of a remote data root to a local SSD.

What it does
------------
Mirrors the source directory tree under a local root, clipping each dataset
to a bbox so only a fraction of bytes lands locally. The matching data
catalog yaml then just needs its ``meta.root`` swapped to the local path.

Configuration
-------------
All knobs live in a YAML file (default: ``dev/scripts/stage_data.yml``):

    source_root: P:/wflow_global/hydromt
    target_root: C:/data/wflow_global/hydromt
    bbox: [8.5, -0.5, 11.0, 1.5]   # west, south, east, north
    datasets:
      - {name: vito,  type: raster,      path: landuse/vito/.../foo.tif}
      - {name: tiles, type: raster_glob, path: topography/.../30sec, pattern: "*.tif", workers: 4}
      - {name: idx,   type: vector,      path: topography/.../basin_index.gpkg,
         columns: [geometry, id]}
      - {name: era5,  type: zarr,        path: meteo/era5_daily.zarr}
      - {name: orog,  type: netcdf,      path: meteo/.../era5_orography_2018.nc}
      - {name: chirps, type: netcdf_glob, path: meteo/chirps_africa_daily_v2.0,
         pattern: "CHIRPS_rainfall_*.nc", time_range: [...], variables: [...]}

Usage
-----
    python dev/scripts/stage_data.py
    python dev/scripts/stage_data.py --config dev/scripts/stage_data.yml
    python dev/scripts/stage_data.py --bbox 8 -1 12 2     # CLI overrides

# output is treated as stale and re-staged.  This is what makes "skip if
# exists" actually safe across YAML edits.
#
# Two freshness strategies (see `staged`):
#   - "exact"      : every fingerprint key must match (raster/vector/zarr/netcdf).
#   - "time_cover" : bbox + variables must match exactly, but TIME is coverage-
#                    based — used for per-file `netcdf_glob` members so that
#                    WIDENING a time_range only stages the newly-in-range files
#                    and leaves unchanged years untouched.  Each such manifest
#                    also records the source file's natural time span
#                    (`natural_time`) and the effective window written
#                    (`clip_time`).  A file is fresh iff, recomputing the clip
#                    window from the stored natural span and the NEW request, it
#                    equals the stored `clip_time` — an exact test (no false

#: Serialises every netCDF touch this module makes from a worker: each
#: `netcdf_glob` file's whole unit of work (open, clip, write, close) and every
#: write (`_clip_netcdf_to_file`). Reentrant, because the write is taken again
#: inside the unit.
#:
#: WIDENED 2026-09-25 (t2608071208): the write-only lock below was not enough.
#: CI run 36179897121 hung with the complete thread dump this note had waited
#: for: the writer HELD this lock while two readers of other glob files were
#: entering xarray's own netCDF locks, and no thread was inside netCDF I/O.
#: Whatever the xarray-level mechanism (a lock-order inversion inside
#: `CombinedLock` was probed and is recorded on the board), it needs two
#: threads in the library at once, so now at most one is. The cost is the read
#: parallelism the narrow version kept for `netcdf_glob` -- a dev staging tool,
#: and a slower stage beats one that hangs without a timeout.
#:
#: History, as first written:
#:
#: `_run_glob` stages a glob across a `ThreadPoolExecutor`, and
#: `_raster_glob_workers` returns 4 for any glob holding more than five files --
#: a policy written for rasterio, where threads are safe, and inherited by the
#: netcdf path, where they are not. HDF5 is not thread-safe and netCDF4-python
#: funnels through a global lock, so four workers all ending in
#: `sub.to_netcdf(dst)` open the library concurrently.
#:
#: On 2026-08-18 one of them stopped coming back: a worker blocked forever in
#: `xarray/backends/netCDF4_.py NetCDF4DataStore.open`, and the main thread sat
#: in `as_completed` behind it, which is the t2608071208 stall that had taken
#: the Windows CI leg down for 30 minutes. Same family as the CHIRPS deadlock
#: `b03d965` fixed by making that write synchronous.
#:
#: Deliberately narrow: only the WRITE serialises. Reading, clipping and the
#: whole `raster_glob` path keep their workers, so the parallel staging added
#: for CMIP6 is untouched. For `netcdf_glob` specifically the write is most of
#: the work, so that stage is now effectively serial -- which is the trade, and
#: a slower stage beats one that hangs without a timeout.
#:
#: HONEST LIMIT: this is reasoned from the captured stacks, not demonstrated.
#: The hang would not reproduce on demand -- 180 staged widen passes across
#: three deliberate attempts, including four concurrent processes, all clean --
#: so nothing here can be shown to fix it, only to remove the contention the
#: stacks show. If it recurs, the harness now dumps its own threads and the
#: next stack will say whether this lock was held.
