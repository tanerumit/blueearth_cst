"""Stage A1 — acquire one raw slice of a remote GCM store (design revision 6).

The **only** module in WF2 that opens the remote store. Stage A used to fetch and
reduce in one job, so anything invalidating the *reduction* re-triggered the
*download*: an edit to a formula cost nine remote reads. This split makes a
reduction edit re-read local disk instead.

Why the split is worth its second cache, measured on 2026-07-30
(`dev/milestones/r08/2026-07-30_wf2-fetch-reduce-benchmark.md`):

* opening one source (catalog URI glob resolution + store metadata): **1142 s**
* transferring its data (``.load()``): **19 s**
* the reduction arithmetic: **0.2 s**
* the raw slice on disk: **0.07 MB**

So the dominant cost is the *open*, which means the reduce stage must make **zero**
remote calls — not merely avoid the transfer. It therefore reads this file and
checks the digest recorded on it, which already encodes the store-index pins,
rather than reopening the store to re-verify them.
`series_identity.assert_raw_identity` is the check that makes that safe.

Contract with the reduce stage:

* this job writes ``cst_raw_digest`` = :func:`series_identity.raw_digest`, which
  excludes the reducer hash — that exclusion is what makes a formula edit free;
* the write is atomic, so a killed job cannot leave a valid-looking short file;
* the reduce job refuses a slice whose digest, schema, variables, time axis or
  recorded window disagree with what it expects.

``snakemake.input/output/params``, never ``sys.argv``.

    Two ways a CMIP6 read overflows `datetime64[ns]`, whose ceiling is

    TO 2300 under an `sspNNN` experiment id, and both arrive as

        Cannot cast ... to unit='ns' without overflow
        OutOfBoundsDatetime: Out of bounds nanosecond timestamp: 2262-04-16

    **One axis, decoded too narrow.** A non-standard calendar (`noleap`,
    `360_day`) decodes to a `CFTimeIndex`, and hydromt's `harmonise_dims` ends
    by converting it with `CFTimeIndex.to_datetimeindex()` and no `time_unit`,
    which defaults to nanoseconds. Converting it ourselves at second resolution
    first leaves hydromt's own `dtype == "O"` test False, so its conversion
    becomes a no-op and none of its lon/lat harmonisation is reimplemented here
    -- that function is called verbatim for everything it does well.
    `CCCma/CanESM5 ssp585` is this case.

    **Two axes, meeting at different widths.** This preprocessor runs per FILE
    inside `open_mfdataset`, and the catalog reads `pr` and `tas` from separate
    stores. A model may extend one variable to 2300 and stop the other at 2100
    -- `IPSL/IPSL-CM6A-LR ssp585` publishes exactly that under ONE version
    (`gr/v20190903`): `pr` runs to 2300 and falls back to cftime, `tas` runs to
    2100 and decodes to `datetime64[ns]`. Widening only the cftime side left the
    two at `[s]` and `[ns]`, and merging them aligns their indexes through
    `pandas.Index.union`, which adopts the FINER unit and overflows on the
    longer axis. The same union is why two published VERSIONS of different
    spans fail (`CSIRO-ARCCSS/ACCESS-CM2 ssp585`).

    So every axis is met at seconds, not only the cftime ones: a merge can only
    be safe if both sides are already wide. :func:`seconds_resolution_index`
    refuses to coarsen an axis that would lose precision, so this cannot quietly
    truncate a sub-second time coordinate to make a union succeed.

    The axis is cast back to nanoseconds in :func:`fetch_raw_slice`, AFTER the
    acquisition window has dropped the extension years -- so a slice that
    already staged is written exactly as before, and this changes only which
    sources can be read at all.

    xarray already warns that `to_datetimeindex`'s default becomes microseconds
    in a future release, which would raise the ceiling to year 294 247. That
    would fix the first case and NOT the second: two axes at `[us]` and `[ns]`
    still meet at `[ns]`, and a 2300 axis still does not fit there.

    hydromt maps the bbox through the grid's affine transform and rounds to whole

    irregular axis does not have -- but the transform is only ever used to ask

    * ``buffer`` is in CELLS, not degrees. hydromt has always read it as

      would differ silently inside one ensemble. The config key said
      ``buffer_degrees`` until t2608182238, which is the misnomer this reading

      ~6% of pinned stores match more than one. Two concatenated stores give a
      duplicated time axis, which halves the effective record while looking
      fine.
    * **an empty window** -- ``.load()`` succeeds, the duplicate test is
      trivially true (0 == 0), and the attrs block then dies on ``index[0]``
      with a bare ``IndexError`` naming neither the source nor the window.
      Reachable on real input -- a historical run starting after 1950, or a
      truncated ssp store -- and **invisible to the fixture gate**, whose three
      models all cover their windows.

    Called BEFORE ``.load()``: coordinates are read at open, so this costs
    nothing lazily and an ambiguous or empty source fails without first
    transferring every selected chunk (~19 s on the benchmark source).

    ``driver_index`` is the axis as the DRIVER returned it, before ``.sel()``
