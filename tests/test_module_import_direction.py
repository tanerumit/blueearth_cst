"""R7-4: the model-free climate path must not import from the model package.

`blueearth_cst/climate_analysis/` exists so a full climate analysis runs from
region + catalog alone, with no wflow setup or run (design P4). An import from
`blueearth_cst/model/` does not necessarily COUPLE anything -- the parity
transform it used to reach for is pure xarray in/out -- but the direction
contradicts the one claim the package is there to make, and a convention that
nothing checks drifts back.

The transform now lives in `shared/`, which is where genuinely engine-neutral
helpers belong: two callers use it from opposite sides, `model/plot_results.py`
at model parity and `climate_analysis/plot_climate_source.py` on the source
grid.
