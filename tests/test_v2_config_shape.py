"""The v2 project config shape parses, composes and builds a DAG.

P1's acceptance surface (R14 `config-shape-p1-loader.task.md`). The fixture is
`tests/data/v2/project_config_v2_probe.yml`, hand-written rather than migrated:
P4 owns `tests/project_config_fixture.yml` and migrates it WITH the rewriter, so
a P1 test that edited it would be doing P4's job with a worse tool.

**This module is P1b's acceptance surface as well as P1's.** P1 moved the T1
reads — the `project:`, `basin:`, `climate:` and `model:` sections, which is
what `shared:` dissolved into — and two entry points dry-ran clean. P1b moved
the T2 reads, the per-workflow key renames, one workflow per commit: WF1
(`C-22`, `C-56`), WF2 (`C-25`, `C-59`, `C-60`, `C-63`) and WF3 (`C-68`, `C-31`,
`C-32`, `C-33`, `C-67`, `C-69`, `C-29`, `C-34`). All four are in ``V2_CLEAN``
now, so the ``V2_BLOCKED`` boundary marker this module carried is gone.

Still owed, and NOT by P1b: `C-57` and `C-64` need a per-variable registry that
does not exist, and `C-66` cannot dissolve `relative_change:` without it. Those
are P1c. The long form of `variables:` is not retired, so the fixture uses it.
