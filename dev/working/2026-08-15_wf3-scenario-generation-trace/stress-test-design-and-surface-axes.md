# Separating the experiment from the response surface

Status: DESIGN NOTE, 2026-08-15. **Not an accepted design and not a task brief.**
It records a design conversation and the owner rulings taken during it, so they
survive as something reviewable. Six questions were opened and closed across that
conversation; §6 indexes the outcomes. Nothing here is implemented.

**Revised 2026-08-15**, same day, after the precondition test in §5 was run: one
ruling withdrawn, one qualified, one Q2 qualifier added. The revisions are marked
in place and indexed at the foot of §6 — this note is a record of a design
conversation, so nothing is rewritten to look as though it was always right.

Companions in this folder: `trace.md` (the run, and its measured cost profile) and
`wf3-rule-reference.md` (every rule, its scripts and file shapes).

---

## 1. The separation this rests on

Two things are currently fused in WF3 and are conceptually distinct:

| | what it is | what it owns |
|---|---|---|
| **The experiment** | perturbed climatology → simulated hydrology → simulated indicators | what was actually imposed, and what the system did in response |
| **The response surface** | a post-processed *view* of those indicators | how a member is summarised into an axis value, and how the plot is labelled |

Today the second is baked into the first: `export_wflow_results.annual_perturbation`
collapses each member's twelve monthly values to one annual figure **at reduction
time**, and writes it into the indicator tables as `temp_change` / `precip_change`.
Any other axis is then unrecoverable from the results alone.

The consequence is not just missing flexibility — see §3, it can make the plot
misreport what the experiment explored.

## 2. Merging the two parameter artifacts

Today the grid is written as two shapes:

- `<wg>/_work/st_<id>.csv` — per member, twelve monthly rows, columns
  `month, temp_mean, precip_mean, precip_variance`. Precip is a **multiplier**.
- `<exp>/config/stress_test_design.csv` — one row per member, columns
  `st_id, temp_change, precip_change, precip_variance_change`. Precip is a
  **percent**, and the values are the **annual collapse** of the monthly ones.

**The second is a materialized cache of the first.** `prepare_cst_parameters.py:175`
writes the member CSV, reads it back off disk, and calls the same
`annual_perturbation` the reduction later calls, to build the design row. HM-7 says
so plainly — those axis columns are *"a cached copy, derived independently by the
writer, so they really can drift"* — and `validate_hm7` exists to police exactly
that gap.

**Proposal (owner, 2026-08-15): one long lookup table** at monthly grain, keyed by
member:

```
st_id, month, temp_change, precip_change, precip_variance_change
1,     1,     …
1,     2,     …
…             (twelve rows per member)
2,     1,     …
```

What it buys, in order of importance:

1. **The monthly detail survives to post-processing**, which is what makes §3
   possible at all.
2. **It removes a cache and one of its two derivations**, and with them the
   drift class `validate_hm7` currently guards.
3. **A new perturbation parameter is a column**, not a new file shape. (Caveat:
   this removes the *shape* barrier to a third axis, not the *contract* barrier —
   C28 refuses one deliberately because a new dimension must reach the design
   table and the results columns together.)
4. `_work/` disappears entirely. The merged table belongs in `<exp>/config/`
   beside the config snapshot: it is a record of what ran, not scratch.

### Units — RULED

> **Ruling (owner, 2026-08-15): percent, everywhere.** `temp_change` in °C,
> `precip_change` and `precip_variance_change` in **percent**. Column names stay
> `temp_change` / `precip_change` rather than unit-suffixed variants
> (`precip_change_pct`), by owner preference.

The criterion was consistency across artifacts, not internal convenience, and the
tally settles it — WF2 **already emits percent**, with an explicit `relative_units`
column carrying `%` for precip and `degC` for temp:

| artifact | precip convention |
|---|---|
| WF2 change factors | percent |
| WF3 `stress_test_design.csv` | percent |
| WF3 indicator tables (`precip_change`) | percent |
| WF3 member files `st_*.csv` | **multiplier** — the sole outlier |

Three of four already agree, and the two that matter most cannot diverge: HM-7
requires the stress-test axes to match WF2's definition *because the GCM dots are
overlaid on them*. Percent makes the imposed change, the reported axis and the
projection factor one quantity in one unit.

The multiplier survives only as the generator's operation form —
`impose_climate_change.R` converts `1 + p/100` once, at the point of application.

**An argument considered and withdrawn.** "Store what is applied (factors), because
a rounding error there changes the science" does not survive scrutiny. The incident
that seemed to support it — `float32(0.7)` → `−30.000001%`, which is why
`prepare_cst_parameters.py:174` computes the design row from the persisted CSV —
was a **float32-vs-float64 CSV round-trip** problem, not a unit-choice one. Percent
stored at adequate precision has the same property: every reader converts
deterministically to the same factor.

Consequence worth knowing: no-change becomes `0.0` rather than `1.0`, so a row of
zeros now visibly means "no perturbation" and `st_0`'s row reads as the origin.

**Invalidation is not a reason against it.** Rule 3.12 declares one member file per
job today, but rule 3.09 writes *all* member files in a single job, so any config
change rewrites all of them and re-fires every 3.12 job anyway. The per-file split
buys no invalidation granularity.

## 3. Why the axis has to be a parameter

Stress testing here is **extended sensitivity analysis**: the question is how the
system responds across an explored range. The axis must therefore report *the range
that was explored*.

The fixed annual collapse fails that for any seasonal design. Perturb JJA by +30%
and leave the rest unchanged, and the month-length-weighted annual figure is

```
(92 × 1.30 + 273 × 1.00) / 365 = 1.076  →  +7.6%
```

so the axis reads **+7.6%** for a member that imposed **+30% in the wet season**.
The response came from a concentrated seasonal change; the label describes a mild
uniform one. The more concentrated the perturbation, the worse it gets — perturb a
single month and the entire explored range compresses to roughly a twelfth of its
true magnitude.

So for a seasonal design the axis definition is a **correctness requirement**, not a
presentation preference.

**Shape.** The axis becomes a user-declared triple applied at post-processing —
variable, month set, statistic — e.g. `{variable: precip, months: [6,7,8],
statistic: mean}`.

**Two constraints to carry:**

- **Linear statistics only, or the grid guarantee breaks.** HM-7 lets consumers
  rely on the axis being evenly spaced: "the collapse is affine in the member's
  step index, so the surface is rectilinear." Any mean over any month subset
  preserves that. A non-linear statistic — a max, a quantile — does not, and the
  surface stops being a regular grid.
- **The same collapse must be applied to the projection overlay.** HM-7 already
  records why: the CMIP6 dots are placed on these axes, and "two different
  collapses would compare two different quantities." (Overlay treatment is
  explicitly deferred — see Open questions.)

### The lookup is the source of truth — RULED

> **Ruling (owner, 2026-08-15).** The lookup table is the **source of truth**. From
> the lookup plus the results, any response surface can be generated — within the
> logical bounds of §4. Nothing derived from it is stored.

The lookup holds all twelve months for every member, which makes it a **sufficient
statistic** for any collapse: annual, a season, a single month, even a non-linear
one. Every axis is a projection of it.

Three consequences, and the third corrects an earlier draft of this note:

1. **Indicator tables carry `st_id` and `value`, not a baked axis.** Keeping
   `temp_change` / `precip_change` there would privilege one collapse and
   re-create the drift `validate_hm7` polices. It also spares no one a join —
   consumers need the lookup regardless, so it *is* the second file.
2. **A surface is a declaration plus a figure**, not a directory of data: the
   collapse, the caption and the exclusions (`st_0`) are a *choice* and must be
   recorded; the axis values are a derivation and must not.
3. **An earlier proposal to materialize a per-surface `axes.csv` is withdrawn.**
   It reintroduced, one layer up, exactly the cache-of-a-derivation this design
   removes. Caught by the owner: given the lookup, an axis table stores something
   already fully determined.

The general principle, which is the same one that killed the design-table cache:
**store the finest grain that was actually imposed; derive every summary.**

#### The qualifier: the lookup determines the AXIS, not the SCENARIO

Added 2026-08-15, from the §5 precondition test. "Sufficient statistic" holds for
**axis derivation** — every collapse is a projection of the twelve monthly rows,
which is what Q2 and Q5 rest on. It does **not** hold for **scenario identity**.

`st_0` and the grid's identity member carry *identical* all-zero lookup rows —
`stress_test_design.csv` already shows `2,0.0,0.0,0.0` on the baseline config —
and they are demonstrably different climates: 70% apart on `q_mean_annual_min`,
measured. Two rows the lookup cannot distinguish, two scenarios that are not the
same. The cause is in §5: `st_0` is the raw generated series, every member is
that series round-tripped through the perturbation, and the round-trip is not the
identity even at unit factors.

Nothing in Q2 breaks — `st_0` is off the surface by ruling 5, and the members
remain distinguishable from each other, which is all an axis needs. The bite is
on the one artifact that puts `st_0` beside the surface: ruling 5's annotated
reference value.

Worth recording as an inversion: consequence 3 above withdrew a materialized
`axes.csv` because it cached a derivation. The `alias_of` column §5 proposed is
withdrawn with the alias — but the *need* it pointed at survives inverted. What
wants marking is no longer "these two rows are the same scenario, one was copied"
but "these two rows are identical and are **not** the same scenario."

The one case for materializing, recorded so it stays a decision rather than an
oversight: archiving a *published* figure, where the exact plotted numbers should
sit beside it rather than be recomputed years later from code that has moved. That
is a publication-provenance concern, better served by an export-on-demand than by
writing a file every run.

## 4. The three interpretable designs

Owner's taxonomy, 2026-08-15. All three are **already expressible** in the current
config; no mechanism change is needed on the design side. In config terms precip is
a multiplier, so "no change" is `1.0`:

| case | `min` | `max` | axis caption |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — uniform | `[0.7]×12` | `[1.3]×12` | mean change in precipitation |
| 2 — some months vary, rest unchanged | `[0.7,0.7,0.7, 1.0×9]` | `[1.3,1.3,1.3, 1.0×9]` | mean change over JFM; Apr–Dec unchanged |
| 3 — some months vary, rest held at an offset | `[0.7,0.7,0.7, 0.8×9]` | `[1.3,1.3,1.3, 0.8×9]` | mean change over JFM; Apr–Dec held at −20% |

### The criterion underneath the taxonomy

Members are built by `np.linspace(min_vector, max_vector, …)`, so member *j* is
`min + (j/n)(max − min)` month by month — a one-parameter family. A scalar axis
therefore always exists mathematically, even for a design where Jan swings ±30%
while Feb swings 0→+50%.

It is only **interpretable** when every varying month shares the same `min` and
`max`. Then the mean over the varying months *equals the change applied to each of
them*, so the axis reports the imposed value rather than an average of unlike
things. The three cases above are exactly that family.

**This is checkable, and could be a validation:** warn when varying months carry
differing `(min, max)` pairs, because the axis then averages dissimilar
perturbations and no caption can describe it honestly.

### The caption should be derived, not typed

From a per-member × per-month table you can read off the **varying months** (value
differs across `st_id`) and the **held months and their level** (constant across
`st_id`). That yields the captions in the table above mechanically. A typed label
can drift from the design it describes; a derived one cannot — and this is the
strongest argument for the merged table beyond simplification.

### A consequence for `step_num`

A no-change member exists only when the no-change value lands on a level. For
`min 0.7, max 1.3` that requires an **even `step_num`**. The shipped rapid config
uses `step_num: 1`, whose levels are 0.7 and 1.3 with nothing at 1.0 — so an even
`step_num` is a real modelling choice (it puts the origin inside the design), not
an arbitrary number.

## 5. `st_0`, and a duplication

> **Ruling (owner, 2026-08-15).** `st_0` is **not a member of the response
> surface**. It exists to give users information about the baseline — no climate
> change, stochastic realizations — and is reported as an annotated reference
> value beside the surface rather than plotted as a grid node.

Two things follow.

**It stays simulated.** Two of the eleven `q` metrics are derived *from* `st_0`, so
`run_historical: true` is load-bearing; `false` drops them with nothing reporting
it. Excluding it from the surface is a presentation filter (`st_id != 0`) and costs
nothing structurally — the indicator tables already carry `st_id`.

> **Caveat added 2026-08-15 — the ruling stands, the annotation needs a health
> warning.** `st_0` is the raw generated series; every grid member is `st_0`
> round-tripped through the perturbation of rule 3.12, which is *not* the
> identity at unit factors (see the withdrawal below). Baseline and surface
> therefore differ by a **processing step**, not only by a perturbation, and
> "reported as an annotated reference value beside the surface" compares two
> differently-processed climates for most indicators. Measured `st_0` → identity
> member: one of eleven `q` metrics preserved (`q_annual_mean`, +0.2%), five
> within 20%, and five moved by a *factor* — all five low-flow
> (`q_mean_annual_min` −69.7%, `q_baseflow_index` −57.0%,
> `q_return_level_2yr_7day_min` +127.9%). Admitted to the board as its own item
> (`origin: R12`); it is a live property of the shipped pipeline, not of this
> design.

**It amends a recorded rationale.** `prepare_cst_parameters.py:117` justifies the
`st_0` design row the other way round — *"a response surface missing its own origin
forces every downstream consumer to reconstruct it"* — i.e. C23 assumed `st_0` **is**
the surface origin. The row stays; the stated reason for it changes, and the comment
should say so rather than continue asserting the old intent.

### The duplication

When a grid member's perturbation is the identity in **every** month (temp +0,
precip ×1.0), that member *is* `st_0` — the same scenario simulated twice. It
happens in cases 1 and 2 with an even `step_num`, and **never in case 3**, where the
zero-axis member still holds Apr–Dec at −20%.

Scale, stated so it is not over-valued: the duplicate is exactly **one member
regardless of grid size**, so the saving is `1/(ST_NUM+1)` — 10% on a 3×3, 4% on a
5×5, and zero on the shipped rapid config, which has no identity member at all.
This is a design-cleanliness argument more than an efficiency one.

> **Ruling (owner, 2026-08-15): option A — alias the result, keep `st_id` dense.**
> Do not simulate the identity member; reuse `st_0`'s result for it. The rejected

The two obligations this created, and what became of them:

1. **Verify the premise first — it is a precondition, not a nice-to-have.** Option A
   *copies* `st_0`'s result into another member's slot, so if the two are not truly
   the same scenario, it fabricates a result rather than reusing one. `× 1.0` and
   `+ 0.0` are exact in floating point and a ramped zero perturbation is still zero,
   so the values *should* match — but `impose_climate_change.R` round-trips the
   netCDF through R's writer, so this is a claim to test, not assume. Cheap test:
   an even-`step_num` config, `--notemp`, compare the identity member's forcing and
   output CSV against `st_0`'s. A mismatch is itself a finding.

   **Done 2026-08-15. Mismatch. The reasoning was right about the FACTORS and
   wrong about the TRANSFORM.** No run was needed: `project_config_baseline.yml`
   already has an identity member — temp `step_num: 1` (levels 0.0, 3.0), precip
   `step_num: 2` (levels 0.7, **1.0**, 1.3), variance flat — and with the grid's
   temp-outer/precip-inner order that is `st_2`, which `stress_test_design.csv`
   confirms as `2,0.0,0.0,0.0`. The run TOMLs are identical apart from paths.

   - **The factors are exact; `apply_climate_perturbations` is not a scaling.**
     `deparse(body(...))` line 263 sends every grid cell through
     `adjust_precipitation_qm(...)` **unconditionally** — there is no
     `mean_factor == 1` short-circuit. It is empirical → fitted-Gamma quantile
     mapping, so the daily series is replaced by its fitted-distribution image
     whatever the factor.
   - **Probed on weathergenr 1.2.0 directly** (so the finding does not depend on
     the pre-1.2.0 fixture): temperature *is* exactly the identity at
     `temp_delta = 0`; precipitation is not, and every wet day changes. **All
     twelve monthly means are preserved to +0.0000%** — `enforce_target_mean` is
     per-month, which also settles that the class-C month selection is stable
     (wettest 12→12, driest 8→8). The tail is compressed: single max day −32.9%,
     max 7-day sum −19.9%, sd −4.9%.
   - **`st_0` → `st_2` in the fixture's `q_indicators.csv`**, mean over locations
     × realizations: `q_annual_mean` +0.2%; `q_mean_annual_p95` −1.2%;
     `q_wettest_month_mean` −3.7%; `q_mean_annual_7day_max` −10.0%;
     `q_mean_annual_max` −14.9%; `q_return_level_10yr_max` −18.4%;
     `q_driest_month_mean` −52.6%; `q_baseflow_index` −57.0%;
     `q_mean_annual_7day_min` −59.9%; `q_mean_annual_min` −69.7%;
     `q_return_level_2yr_7day_min` +127.9%. A gradient with a cliff: one
     preserved, five within 20%, five moved by a factor — every one of the last
     five a low-flow indicator, because the model amplifies the tail compression.
     Aliasing would have fabricated those.
   - **Why it hid, and why the mean looked fine.** `st_0` sits *inside* the member
     envelope for every metric — the grid spans ±30% precip and +3 °C, far wider
     than the artifact — so it never reads as an outlier; it is at the wrong place
     on the axis. And the discharge means differ by −1.5% (`rlz_1`) and +2.0%
     (`rlz_2`), opposite signs: sampling noise, exactly as monthly-mean
     preservation predicts.
   - **Magnitudes carry a caveat.** `test_case/test_local` predates the
     2026-08-12 weathergenr 1.2.0 rename, so the per-metric table comes from the
     older `imposeClimateChanges`. The 1.2.0 probe agrees in direction and
     forcing-side magnitude, so the qualitative result is version-independent —
     re-measure before quoting the numbers. Links `t2608121258`.

2. **Mark the alias.** A duplicated result that looks simulated is the kind of thing
   that reads as a defect months later. It needs to be visible — an `alias_of`
   column in the lookup, or a line in the run metadata — rather than two identical
   CSVs with nothing explaining why.

   **Withdrawn with the alias — but see the §3 qualifier**, where the need it
   pointed at survives inverted: what wants marking is not "these rows are the
   same scenario" but "these identical rows are *not* the same scenario."

## 5b. External consumers — CHECKED, and not a constraint

> **Ruling (owner, 2026-08-15).** CST-API and CST-frontend are out of scope for
> this decision. `csthelpers` is in progress and will be updated once the toolbox
> settles.

What the check found, recorded because it is reusable:

`~/workspace/csthelpers` (R package) reads `q_indicators.csv`, groups by
`temp_change, precip_change` and plots them as the surface axes. So an external
consumer of the seven-column shape does exist — but the coupling is weaker than it
looks, in two ways:

- **`plot_climate_surface()` is parameterized, not hardcoded.** It takes
  `x_var` / `y_var` as arguments and validates them against whatever columns are
  passed (`if (!x_var %in% names(data)) stop(...)`). Only the *example* names
  `precip_change`. A caller that joins the lookup and derives a seasonal axis
  simply passes a different column name — so the package already supports the
  flexibility this design is trying to create.
- **Its examples already reference artifacts the pipeline no longer emits** —
  `annual_change_scalar_stats_summary_mean.csv` (replaced at S8-04/05) and
  `Qstats.csv` (pre-R11). It reads vendored snapshots under `csthelpers/data/`,
  not live pipeline output.

So dropping the axis columns is not a live-integration break. It widens a gap that
is already open, in a package whose owner has scheduled the update.

## 5c. Naming — RULED

> **Ruling (owner, 2026-08-15): `stress_test_lookup.csv`**, in `<exp>/config/`.
> The per-member `_work/st_*.csv` are absorbed into it and `_work/` disappears.

`stress_test` rather than `experiment_` keeps the file in the same vocabulary as
its own key column: the key is `st_id`, and the identifiers around it are uniformly
stress-test (`stress_test:` config block, `stress_test_grid()`, `ST_NUM`,
`rlz_1_st_4`). `experiment_design.csv` keyed by `st_id` reads off, and `st_id`
cannot be renamed — HM-7 pins it and it is in every member filename. It would also
restate the `experiments/<name>/config/` directory and sit one suffix away from the
existing `experiment.yml`, which does something completely different (§5d).

`lookup` rather than `design` because the rename's job is to **signal that the
shape moved** to long form. "Design" describes the old artifact just as well as the
new one, so keeping it would pay a migration and buy nothing. A migration note is
required either way (`naming.md` §7).

## 5d. Aside: `experiment.yml` is a latch, not a duplicate

Raised during the Q4 discussion and worth recording, because it looks like
duplication and is not.

`<exp>/config/experiment.yml` (rule 3.07) holds the experiment id plus the resolved
`run_stress_test` section — a subset of what `project_config_run_stress_test.yml`
(rule 3.02) already snapshots. The difference is semantic: the snapshot **records**
and is rewritten every invocation; `experiment.yml` **refuses**, and is immutable
once the experiment has successfully run (`ExperimentConfigFrozenError`, marker =
the merged workflow log, which only exists after a complete run). The snapshot
cannot serve that purpose precisely because it is refreshed — by comparison time it
already says whatever you just changed.

**What the freeze actually prevents, which is not accidental edits.** The rules
have asymmetric rerun triggers:

- **3.07** carries `experiment_cfg = my_cfg` in `params:`, so a `stress_test` edit
  **re-fires** it — which is how the guard sees the change.
- **3.09**, which builds the grid, declares `config = ancient(config_path)` and
  **no params**. `ancient()` suppresses the timestamp trigger and there is no value
  to compare, so a `stress_test` edit **does not re-fire the grid rule**.

So on a same-name re-run with changed parameters: the member files keep the OLD
grid, most of the pipeline stays up to date against them, but 3.02 re-fires and
rewrites the snapshot to the NEW parameters. The result is old numbers beside a
record claiming new settings — silently, with every rule green. The freeze refuses
that rather than half-propagating it, and directs the user to a new experiment name.
The model it enforces: **an experiment is an identity, not a workspace.**

**The critique that follows, for R12.** The freeze compensates for a missing rerun
trigger. `ancient()` on 3.09 exists so that touching the config does not re-run a
multi-hour experiment, but the cost is that the grid rule is deaf to the parameters
it exists to expand. If it carried the stress-test block in `params:` instead, a
change would propagate correctly and "should we allow an in-place parameter change?"
would become a design choice rather than a defect to block. Not proposed here;
noted because it is squarely R12's territory (*how WF3 executes*).

## 6. What is settled, and what is left

All six questions this note opened with are now closed or deliberately deferred.
Rulings are recorded in place above; this is the index.

| # | question | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | units | **RULED** — percent everywhere; column names `temp_change` / `precip_change` (§2) |
| 2 | where the annual value lives | **RULED** — the lookup is the source of truth; results carry `st_id` + `value`; axes derived, never stored (§3) |
| 3 | external consumers | **RULED** — none constrains this; `csthelpers` is parameterized and its owner will update it (§5b) |
| 4 | naming | **RULED** — `stress_test_lookup.csv` (§5c) |
| 5 | multiple surfaces per experiment | **CLOSED as a consequence of Q2** — see below |
| 6 | the projection overlay | **DEFERRED**, deliberately — see below |

Two §5 rulings moved after that index was written, both on 2026-08-15, both from
the precondition test the note itself demanded:

| ruling | outcome |
|---|---|
| §5 — `st_0` is not a surface member, reported as an annotated reference | **STANDS, with a caveat.** The annotation compares two differently-processed climates for ten of eleven `q` metrics; admitted to the board on its own terms (`origin: R12`) |
| §5 — option A, alias the identity member onto `st_0` | **WITHDRAWN.** The premise is false: the perturbation is not the identity at unit factors, so there was never a duplicate to remove |

Q2 gains a qualifier rather than a change (§3): the lookup determines the **axis**,
not the **scenario** — `st_0` and the identity member carry identical all-zero rows
and are different climates.

### Q5 — closed by Q2, with a fact recorded rather than a defect

Q2 settles the mechanism: the lookup is a sufficient statistic, so any collapse is
derivable and multiple surfaces need nothing further.

What remains is a limit worth stating plainly so nobody rediscovers it as a bug.
Within one experiment every member lies on the line from `min` to `max`, so every
linear axis is an affine image of every other: **two surfaces from one experiment
differ in magnitude and label, not in shape or member ordering.**

That is not a limitation to fix — it is what makes case 2 worth having. Reporting
"+30% over JFM" instead of "+7.6% annual" is the *same* surface, correctly labelled
rather than misleadingly. The response is fixed by the runs; the honest description
of it is not.

Genuinely different response *shapes* would require members varying seasonal
pattern independently — a second design dimension, colliding with C28's deliberate
two-axis refusal. Not proposed, and a much larger change than anything here.

### Q6 — deferred, with the constraint pinned so it cannot drift

> **Owner, 2026-08-15: the overlay is deferred until the above settles.** The

The constraint is inherited, not new. HM-7 records that the CMIP6 dots are placed
on the stress-test axes, so *"two different collapses would compare two different
quantities."* Under this design that becomes concrete and mechanical: **whatever
collapse a surface declares must be applied to the GCM change factors too.**

The Q1 ruling makes that cheap. WF2 already emits **monthly** change factors in
**percent** — `cmip6_change_factors_monthly.csv` carries a `month` column and
`relative_value` in `%` — so the same month-set collapse runs over the GCM table
and over the lookup with no unit conversion between them. The overlay and the
design speak one language by construction.

So the deferral costs nothing structurally: the monthly source already exists in
matching units, and nothing in the rulings above forecloses a treatment.

## 7. Where this would land

Not here. R12 owns *how WF3 executes* (`dev/roadmap.md` § Phase 8) and
`t2608082036` is its open design item; the reduction and reporting side sits
adjacent to it. Anything from this note that becomes work should be admitted to the
board on its own terms, with `trace.md` § 3 as the cost baseline.

### 7b. "Adjacent" was too weak — R12 depends on this, and the order is ruled

> **Ruling (owner, 2026-08-15): the lookup lands first; R12's member-identity
> re-derivation follows and defines `member_hash` over the monthly lookup rows.**

Established 2026-08-15 by reading the archived v2 design rather than reasoning
from territory. `design-v4.md` § 5.1 (on `docs/wf3-redesign`, cited by path — the
branch is never merged) defines

```
member_hash = sha256({member_id, rlz, cst, baseline, seed_r,
                      weathergen_template_digest, st_params_digest,
                      tavg, prcp, precip_variance, run_config_digest})
```

and its own field note says `tavg` / `prcp` / `precip_variance` are *"the annual
scalars the response surface is indexed by, derived exactly as the reduction
derives them today."* **Those three terms are the annual collapse this note
abolishes** — verified at current HEAD rather than trusting the doc's pre-R9 line
citation, which has moved: `perturbation_axes` → `annual_perturbation`,
month-length-weighted mean for temperature and `precip_mean * 100 - 100` for
precipitation (`blueearth_cst/experiment/export_wflow_results.py:300-318`).

So R12's **member-level freshness boundary is defined over an artifact this
design deletes.** That is a dependency with a direction, not a boundary dispute,
and it decides the order: R12's re-derivation is its declared first task, the
review record lists "the member-identity scheme" among what does *not* survive,
and re-deriving it against an artifact about to change spends the work twice.

**The replacement is strictly more faithful, not merely different:** a digest over
the member's twelve lookup rows, rather than a collapse that §3 shows misreports a
seasonal design by construction.

Three things the same reading settled, recorded so they are not re-derived:

- **`st_params_digest` transfers verbatim.** It keys on the *config section*
  rather than the member files because rule 3.01 runs before those files exist.
  Collapsing twelve member files into one lookup does not change that ordering,
  so the argument survives unedited.
- **§5d's `ancient()` critique already has its repair in the design R12
  inherits.** `design-v4.md` threads `file_digest_or_absent(...)` through
  `params:` precisely so a content-only change re-triggers past `ancient()`. §5d
  is therefore a *solved-elsewhere* item, not an open one.
- **§ 6.6 of that design already formalizes what `t2608151154` reports.**
  `baseline: true` members carry `st_csv: null`, skip the perturb step entirely,
  and downscale straight from `baseline_nc` — st_0's separate production path,
  encoded structurally, without its being recognised as a comparability problem.

A hypothesis tested and **falsified**, recorded so nobody re-runs it: that `st_0`
and the identity member would collide under `member_hash`. They cannot —
`member_id` and `baseline` are both terms in the tuple.

Out of scope here, touching the same terms: `precip_variance` sits in the hash
under the G1 retention ruling, with `R9-F1` as its named followup.
