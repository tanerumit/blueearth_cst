    ONE rule definition, declared in ``build_model.smk`` (rule 1.03) and

    generated per candidate source by ``analyze_climate.smk`` (rule 0.03) as
    ``extract_historical_climate_<source>``. All three resolve to the same
    store directory, so whichever workflow runs first extracts and the others
    read what is already there. Over the
    model-independent region specification + data catalog. wf1's `wf1_raw/`
    store and its `staticmaps.nc`-derived bbox are retired: the extent is now a
    pure function of ``shared.basin`` + the catalog, so a climate-only run needs
    no ``models/hydrology/wflow/`` on disk and a region change re-extracts through
    Snakemake's params rerun-trigger (design § B1).

    **The input set is exactly the catalog and shared region in both DAGs.** An
    asymmetric input set re-creates the wf1<->wf3 re-extraction oscillation
    (design P2(b) / ext1-02). The catalog **file** is the source freshness
    boundary (ext2-01), while the region declares the extraction extent; both
    are plain inputs, never ``ancient()``. Data behind an unchanged catalog
    entry is out of scope — edit the entry, or use ``snakemake --forcerun
    extract_climate_datasets`` (in wf0, name the generated source rule).

    Parameters
    ----------
    project_dir : str
        ``project.project_dir``; the store lands under

    model_region : str | Mapping
        ``shared.basin.region`` — the hydromt region specification (usually a
        Python-dict-literal string). Carried in ``params``, never resolved here.
    clim_source : str
        ``shared.clim_historical``. Selects the chirps orography branch.
    historical_window : Mapping
        The ``shared.historical_window`` section, with ``starttime`` and
        ``endtime``. Keyed at day resolution by ``slugify_window``.
    data_sources : str | sequence of str
        ``project.catalog`` — the HydroMT catalog path or ordered paths.
    hydrography, basin_index : str
        ``shared.basin.hydrography`` / ``shared.basin.basin_index`` — catalog
        ENTRY NAMES for the delineation, not paths. Optional config keys; the
        defaults equal the shipped build template's ``setup_basemaps`` values,
        and rule 1.01 fails loud if the two ever disagree.
    enforce_min_years : bool, optional
        Whether a DELIVERED record below ``MIN_HISTORICAL_YEARS`` fails the
        extraction. ``True`` for every store that feeds the pipeline — which is
        every caller except wf0's extra ``candidate_sources``, whose stores end
        at a comparison figure (2026-08-16 owner ruling; see
        ``shared/climate_window.py``).

        ``True`` emits **no param at all**, rather than ``enforce_min_years:
        True``. The params dict is a Snakemake rerun trigger, so adding a key to
        the default path would re-extract every store already on disk and break
        the byte-identity ``tests/test_climate_store_contract.py`` pins across
        the four workflows. Only the relaxed candidates carry the key — and
        because they carry it, promoting one to ``shared.clim_historical``
        changes the params WF1/WF3 declare and re-extracts it under the floor.
    forcing_required : bool, optional
        Whether a precipitation-only source must be enriched into the full
        seven-variable forcing store required by WF1/WF3. ``False`` only for
        wf0's extra comparison candidates. Like ``enforce_min_years``, the
        default is omitted from params so selected-store declarations remain
        unchanged; promotion therefore re-extracts the full forcing store.

    12-member grid gets width 2 (``st_01 … st_12``) because ``st_1, st_11,

    This is what makes an ``ls``, a glob expansion, an IDE tree and the WG-5

    itself.

    Argued through ``experiment.yml``'s freeze and ``check_not_frozen`` until
    2026-09-17. That mechanism was never wired into R12's rule set and its
    module has been deleted (``t2608290250``); content-addressed identity gives
    the same guarantee structurally, by making a changed grid a NEW artifact
    instead of a refused write.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``count`` is not a positive integer. A zero or negative count has no
        width, and returning 1 for it would paper over a broken grid.
