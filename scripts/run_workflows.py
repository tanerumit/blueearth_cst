"""Enabled-aware wrapper over the four CST Snakefiles (design §7).

Reads a full-orchestration `--configfile` YAML, checks each
`workflows.<name>.enabled` flag, and invokes `snakemake -s <name>.smk
--configfile <cfg> ...` for exactly the enabled workflows, in the fixed order
analyze_climate -> build_model -> analyze_projections -> run_stress_test.

This is the evolution of the run_snake_test.cmd / run_snake_docker.sh runners --
a *runner over* the four Snakefiles, NOT a fifth Snakemake entry point. The
Snakefiles do not read `enabled:`; the flag governs this wrapper only.

Contract (pinned, design §7 (a)-(g), plus (h) for the console):

 (a) Full-orchestration configs only: a `workflows:` section with all FOUR
     subsections each carrying an `enabled:` key. The single-workflow
     projections configs (no `workflows:` section) are direct `snakemake -s`
     inputs, not wrapper inputs.

     The set widened from three to four on 2026-08-14 with `analyze_climate`,
     and it stayed a CLOSED, all-required set deliberately. Treating an absent
     subsection as "disabled" would have let existing three-workflow configs
     keep working untouched, and was rejected: the hazard clause (b) exists to
     prevent is SILENCE, not polarity. Under that rule a section misspelled
     `analyse_climate`, or dropped during an edit, skips a workflow while the
     wrapper exits 0 -- which is the same class of failure as the silent
     default-to-true, arriving from the other direction.
 (b) A missing `workflows:` section or a missing `<name>.enabled` subkey is a
     HARD ERROR (nonzero exit, message naming the absent key) -- never a silent
     default to true, and never a silent default to false.
 (c) Each `enabled:` value must PARSE to a real boolean (isinstance(v, bool) on
     the post-yaml.safe_load value). YAML 1.1 resolves unquoted
     true/false/yes/no/on/off to booleans, so all those spellings are accepted;
     quoted strings ("true"), integers (1/0), or any non-bool are REJECTED.
 (d) Enabled workflows run in fixed order; on the first nonzero snakemake exit
     the wrapper STOPS and returns that exit code (does not continue).
 (e) --cores N (default 3) is forwarded to every invocation; args after a `--`
     sentinel are appended verbatim to every invocation. --configfile is
     supplied by the wrapper.
 (f) Per-workflow flags are preserved from a hardcoded map matching the runners:
     --keep-going on analyze_projections only.
 (g) Every valid wrapper invocation creates and atomically finalizes a unique
     `<project_dir>/config/runs/invocations/*.json` lifecycle manifest -- a
     SIBLING of the per-workflow `config/runs/<workflow>/<digest>/` bundles,
     because an invocation spans workflows. Its runner-side config digest
     covers the source YAML plus resolved advanced settings;
     passthrough `--config` overrides are recorded but intentionally excluded,
     because the Snakefile snapshot owns Snakemake's authoritative merged config.
 (h) The wrapper narrates its own run on stdout, and every utterance is
     bounded by a full-width `=` rule (see the Console section for the grammar
     and why it is the one it is). Nothing else in this console draws one, so a
     rule means the RUNNER is speaking rather than the workflow it launched:

     * an OPENING block -- rule, `run_workflows`, rule, then ONE `settings`
       group (project, region, resolution, folder, config, plus `mode` on a dry
       run) and a `sequence` diagram numbering the enabled workflows in
       invocation order and marking the disabled ones in place. The diagram is
       a chain of ASCII boxes joined by `|` / `v`, solid for a workflow that
       will be invoked and dashed for one that will not;

       `settings` answers "which run is this" in one group. It was two --
       `run` for what the command line said, `settings` for what the config
       said -- and where a value came FROM is the writer's distinction rather
       than the reader's. Every row is optional: the wrapper's contract
       validates `workflows:` and nothing else, so a key that is absent is
       simply not printed. Under `region`, a continuation line aligned into the
       value column states the box that specification DELINEATED, read from
       `data/spatial/geoms/region.geojson`, with its approximate extent in km.
       It reads as absent until some workflow has written that file, and is
       never computed from the specification, which names an outlet and an
       upstream-area threshold and so could only yield an invented box
       (`_settings_rows`);
     * one HAND-OFF band per invoked workflow, at its LEADING edge only --
       `<rule>` then `[1/4]  wf0 analyze_climate  --  starting HH:MM:SS` flush
       left, with the sanitized command on the line directly under it. A
       workflow that FAILS gets a closing band too, carrying `FAILED (exit N)
       after <h:mm:ss>` and the fact that later workflows were not invoked;
     * a CLOSING block, framed like the opening one and terminated by a final
       rule: the verdict and total elapsed, each invoked workflow's duration,
       and the paths written.

     There is deliberately NO closing band on SUCCESS. Every workflow already
     signs off with its own `wfN <name> done in <h:mm:ss>` and the paths it
     wrote, so a runner band saying the same thing one line later was a second
     copy of the same fact -- differing only in that the runner's clock also
     counts process startup. The per-workflow durations survive in the closing
     block, which is where a reader compares them anyway. A FAILURE is not
     duplicated: a workflow that dies prints no sign-off, so that band is the
     only place the exit code and the stop decision are stated.

     Deliberately NOT `log_row`'s `HH:MM:SS - <module> - ...`: that grammar is
     worn by every line reported from inside a workflow, so a runner wearing it
     reads as one more rule in the run it supervises. The wrapper therefore also
     ignores `CST_LOG_LEVEL`, which quietens rule logs -- the frame around them
     is not part of what that floor governs.

     Disabled workflows get NO hand-off band: the opening block's sequence
     diagram states every one of them, once, before anything runs. Every line
     that can carry `extra` goes through `sanitize_argv` first.

     stdout is FLUSHED before each `subprocess.run`. Python block-buffers a
     redirected stdout while the child inherits the fd directly, so without the
     flush a `run_workflows.py ... *> log.txt` interleaves each banner AFTER the
     output of the workflow it announces. No test can catch this -- the suite
     fakes `subprocess.run` and the child writes nothing.

 (i) The wf1 PREFLIGHT. When `run_stress_test` is enabled and `build_model` is
     not, the wrapper checks
     `blueearth_cst.shared.cross_workflow_leaves.LEAVES` against `project_dir`
     BEFORE invoking anything, and raises `PrerequisiteError` (exit 2) naming
     every absent leaf and `build_model` as their producer.

     This is an EXISTENCE test, never a comparison -- see the freshness
     paragraph below, which it deliberately does not contradict. A stale leaf
     still resolves the DAG and yields an answer the user owns; an ABSENT one
     makes the DAG unresolvable, so there is no run whose staleness could be
     owned. The check therefore cannot disagree with Snakemake about whether a
     rule should re-run, which is what kept freshness out of the wrapper.

     Added 2026-08-17 (t2608172138). Without it a fresh project with
     `build_model` disabled spends its whole run on wf0 and wf2 and only then
     discovers wf3 was never runnable -- measured at 4:14, of which wf3 was
     0:07. Snakemake's own message names only the FIRST missing leaf, because
     rule 3.01 is merely the earliest to declare one; this names all of them,
     which is why it reads the shared list rather than restating paths.

Disabling a workflow neither deletes its prior outputs nor guarantees downstream
freshness: the wrapper invokes each Snakefile independently with no
prerequisite-freshness check -- identical to invoking a single Snakefile
directly today. A user who disables a prerequisite owns the staleness of what
downstream consumes. Clause (i) is the one bounded exception, and it is about
ABSENCE rather than freshness.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Console: the wrapper's own narration (contract (h))
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The wrapper had no voice of its own until 2026-08-16: it echoed a snakemake
# command line per workflow and nothing else, so a console showing four
# back-to-back Snakemake runs never said which PROJECT they belonged to, which
# of the four were going to run, or how long any of it took. Each Snakefile
# already opens with `run_header` and closes with `run_summary`; the runner
# ABOVE them said less about the run than any one of them.
#
# Row grammar below is deliberately theirs -- labelled groups whose `key  value`
# rows indent one step further and share one value column across the block -- so
# the facts inside a wrapper block read the same way as the facts inside a
# workflow's. It is restated here rather than imported because
# `run_header`/`run_summary` are shaped for a Snakefile's facts (declared path
# tokens, a merged-log and benchmark name), none of which a runner has.
#
# **What the wrapper does NOT share with them is how it is FRAMED**, and that is
# the point. Nested one inside the other, the two blocks were indistinguishable:
# the wrapper's `run` group and `wf0 analyze_climate`'s own `run` group are the
# same label over the same-shaped rows, so a console scrolled back to could not
# be parsed into "the runner said this, then the workflow said that". Every
# wrapper utterance is therefore bounded by a full-width `=` rule -- the opening
# banner, each per-workflow hand-off, the closing banner -- and nothing else in
# this console draws one. A rule means the RUNNER is speaking.
#
# For the same reason the per-workflow rows are NOT `log_row`'s
# `HH:MM:SS - <module> - ...`. That grammar belongs to reporting from INSIDE a
# workflow: every rule log line, every hydromt record and every heartbeat marker
# wears it, so a runner wearing it too reads as one more rule in the run it is
# actually supervising. The wrapper keeps the clock (a start time, an elapsed)
# and drops the costume. It consequently ignores `CST_LOG_LEVEL` entirely, which
# is correct rather than a loss -- that floor exists to quieten rule logs, and
# the runner's dozen lines are the frame around them.
#
# The rule is a FIXED 80 columns, not the terminal's width. A redirected run and
# a console run must produce the same bytes: this output is routinely piped to a
# file (`*> log.txt`), and a frame whose width depended on whether stdout was a
# tty would make the same run look different depending on how it was launched.
#
# ASCII only, everywhere in this section. A Windows console defaults to cp1252
# and raises UnicodeEncodeError on box-drawing characters and arrows -- the same
# constraint `snake_utils.rule_banner` records. `=`, `|`, `-` and `[1/3]`, never
# `═`, `│`, `→` or `✓`.
