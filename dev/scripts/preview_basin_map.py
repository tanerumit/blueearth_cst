"""Render the basin-area figure with any tunable overridden, without a WF1 run.

``blueearth_cst/shared/cartographic_map.py`` opens with a TUNABLE CONSTANTS
block — every size, weight, colour and position the figure uses. This script
drives that block from the command line against a model that already exists on
disk, so a value can be tried and LOOKED AT in seconds instead of edit-rerun-WF1.

    # what can I change, and what is it set to now?
    pixi run python dev/scripts/preview_basin_map.py --list

    # render once with two values changed, and open it
    pixi run python dev/scripts/preview_basin_map.py \
        --set FONT_SIZE_BASE=9 --set _PANEL_LEFT=1.10 --open

    # render one figure PER value, named after it, for side-by-side comparison
    pixi run python dev/scripts/preview_basin_map.py \
        --sweep _LAYOUT_RIGHT=0.70,0.78,0.86

    # two swept knobs render their full cross-product
    pixi run python dev/scripts/preview_basin_map.py \
        --sweep RIVER_WIDTH_MAX=0.8,1.2 --sweep MARKER_SIZE=12,18,28

Overrides are applied to the module's globals and restored afterwards, so
nothing is written back to the source. Renders land in ``--out-dir`` (a
gitignored scratch tree by default) and NEVER in a project's ``plots/``: a
hand-tuned preview must not be able to take the place of a run product that the
baseline fingerprints.

**When adding a tunable to cartographic_map.py**, derive anything assembled from it in a
function (see that module's DERIVED VALUES section). A module-level constant
built from other constants snapshots them at import, so this script would set
the input and silently change nothing.
