# Config templates

**Scaffolds you copy. Nothing here is read by a running workflow.** Copy, fill
in, point a config at your copy.

The configs a rule actually *reads* live in **`config/defaults/`**. Until
2026-08-11 both kinds shared this directory, so its name described only half of
what it held; see `config/defaults/README.md`.

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `project_config.template.yml` | The annotated starting point for a new project's config. A filled-in worked example is `test_case/project_config_baseline.yml`. |
| `output_locations_template.csv` | Header-only schema for gauge/output locations |
| `observed_daily_discharge_template.csv` | Header-only schema for observed discharge |
| `archive/` | Unmaintained single-workflow configs; see its own README |

`wflow_sbm.reference.toml` sits here as a **reference copy only** — no Snakefile,
script or test reads it. Rule 1.07 has hydromt generate the project's own TOML
from hydromt_wflow's defaults. Treat this file as documentation, and expect it to
lag: measured 2026-08-10, it was 126 lines against the 149 a real build emitted.
The `.reference.` infix is there because the bare name `wflow_sbm.toml` read as a
build input, which is exactly what it is not.

**Rename after copying.** Layer names inside the model are derived from your
file's basename (`blueearth_cst/shared/gauges.py`), so a file still called
`output_locations_template.csv` yields layers named `output-locations-template`.
Drop the `_template` suffix when you copy.

# Why the template's defaults are what they are

`project_config.template.yml` states only types and allowed values. The reasoning
behind the non-obvious defaults lives here.

### `historical_window` — minimum 16 years

Enforced at WF1 parse time and again at extraction. weathergenr's wavelet
decomposition needs at least 16 annual observations, so a shorter record cannot
support a stress test at all. The floor is `constraints.min_historical_years` in
`config/advanced_settings.yml` and is **not** overridable per project. This
window was 6 years until 2026-08-01 and would now be rejected.

### `members` — why four labels, not one

Not every model publishes `r1i1p1f1`. CNRM-\*, MIROC-ES2L, UKESM1-0-LL and
MCM-UA-1-0 use `f2`; HadGEM3-GC31-\* use `f3`; CanESM5-CanOE uses `p2f1`. Pinning
`r1i1p1f1` alone silently drops them — 38 of 45 usable models. A label a model
does not publish is simply skipped, because the catalog declares exactly what
exists.

The four shipped labels were chosen empirically over the generated catalog: they
reach 45 models across the tier-1 SSPs. Adding further physics variants (`p3f1`,
`p5f1`, `r1i1000p1f1`, …) reaches *fewer*, because they make a model's historical
and future member sets differ. When those differ, the change-factor stage raises
`asymmetric hist/clim members` rather than quietly using the intersection. With
this list that affects CAMS-CSM1-0, CanESM5, EC-Earth3 (ssp245), GISS-E2-1-G,
GISS-E2-1-H, IPSL-CM6A-LR (ssp434/460), MCM-UA-1-0 and NorESM2-LM (ssp245) — for
those, narrow `members:` to the one label the model shares across your scenarios.

Per-model member counts: `dev/reference/workflows/wf2-cmip6-monthly-members.csv`.

### `historical_year_range` — why 1985–2014

Thirty years ending at the last year the CMIP6 historical experiment covers
(owner ruling OQ-4, 2026-07-29).

- 30 years is the WMO climatological normal, and the workflow warns below 20. A
  shorter reference makes every derived statistic noisier and the tail quantiles
  unsupportable — which is why those are opt-in via `stats:`.
- 2014 ends the historical experiment. Asking for more is not an error: the
  window is **clipped** to 2014 and the run says so on stderr. Scenario data is
  never spliced in to fill the gap, so the extra years simply do not arrive.
- The range is inclusive, so 1985–2014 is thirty calendar years — and with the
  default `shared.water_year_start: Jan`, thirty complete hydrological years. Any
  other start month yields 29, the partial years at both ends dropped. Every
  artifact reports the effective window and count beside the nominal one.
  (The key was `workflows.analyze_projections.start_month_hyd_year` until
  2026-08-12; that spelling is now a parse-time error, and it never reached the
  change-factor arithmetic, which always used January.)

### `experiment_name` — why it is absent rather than set

Left unset, WF3 names the directory from the project's own name plus the date the
experiment was first created, and later runs **reuse** that directory rather than
minting today's date — which is what keeps incremental reruns idempotent. A
placeholder value in the template would instead put every project copied from it
into one shared `experiments/experiment/`.

To pin a deliberate name, run this once before the first climate-experiment run:

```console
pixi run python scripts/suggest_experiment_name.py <your config>
pixi run python scripts/suggest_experiment_name.py <your config> --name dry_scenario
```

It reserves the directory atomically, versions a generated collision to `_v2`,
and refuses to overwrite a name already set — which would strand a completed
experiment's outputs under a name nothing points at.

### `julia_threads` — how it interacts with `--cores`

Wflow parallelizes over grid **cells**, so raising it pays on a large basin and
does nothing on a small one. It is not Snakemake's `--cores`: the two multiply,
so keep `--cores N × julia_threads <= logical CPUs`.

### `batch_size` / `batch_size_max`

WF3 groups stress-test members into batches for the Wflow run. Disk is the
binding constraint on large `RLZ_NUM × ST_NUM` sweeps, because concurrent batches
are resident at once — so `batch_size_max` (default 8) bounds the footprint,
while an explicit `batch_size` wins outright. Both fail at parse time, naming the
offending key, if set below 1.

### `hydrography` / `basin_index`

Catalog **entry names**, not paths. They must match `setup_basemaps` in the
`model_build_config` template, or rule 1.02 fails loudly naming both files and
both values.

# Observation inputs

The two CSV scaffolds above are the optional observation inputs of workflow 1
(`build_model.smk`). Copy them next to your basin data and point the
config at the copies by **absolute path** — real basin data lives in the project
folder, never in this repository (see `AGENTS.md` § Repo Map, the two-tier
`project_dir` rule).

Both inputs are optional. To run without them, set the config keys to `null`:

```yaml
shared:
  basin:
    gauge_points: null
workflows:
  build_model:
    observations_timeseries: null
```

**They work as a pair.** `observations_timeseries` without `gauge_points` has
nothing to key against: the series columns are matched by resolved `wflow_id`,
and those ids only exist once gauge points have driven the delineation.

**Config migration — the old key no longer works on its own.**
`shared.basin.gauge_points` replaces `workflows.build_model.output_locations`
because the points now control the model-neutral basin/subbasin layout as well
as Wflow outputs, and **only the canonical key reaches the rule that delineates
it** (1.03 `delineate_spatial_units`, whose params are `shared.basin` alone per
ADR 0003 §8b — it is declared by all three workflows and the other two carry no
`workflows.build_model` section).

A config that sets ONLY the legacy key therefore fails at parse time with the
migrated key spelled out. This used to be a `FutureWarning` that returned the
path anyway, which was worse than useless: the points still reached the
evaluation rule, so delineation quietly used the automatic fallback and the run
failed a whole model build later, comparing observation station IDs against a
registry built without them. If both keys are set they must name the same path,
so a staged migration can carry both; conflicting values fail at parse time.

Older configs may also write an unquoted `None`, which YAML parses to the Python
**string** `"None"` rather than to null. That remains an accepted unset spelling
during the compatibility release. Prefer a real YAML `null` in new configs.

## `output_locations_template.csv`

Gauge/output locations, **comma**-separated:

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `wflow_id` | optional integer station id; when supplied it must exactly match the deterministic ID generated from the resolved basin/subbasin hierarchy |
| `station_name` | free-text label used in figure titles and metric tables |
| `x`, `y` | longitude, latitude in EPSG:4326 |
| `location_role` | optional role: `control` (default) defines a subbasin; `observation` is tracked without controlling delineation |

### How `wflow_id` is built (changed 2026-08-06 — **existing files must be renumbered**)

```
wflow_id = basin_id*1000 + local_subbasin_number*10 + m
```

`m = 0` for the subbasin's own primary location and `1`–`9` for additional
points inside it. Basin 1 reads `1010, 1011, 1020, 1030…`; basin 2 reads
`2010, 2011, …`. Ids therefore group by basin, order by subbasin, and keep the
subbasin legible in the flat integer.

**This replaces the previous scheme, and old files will not work.** Before
2026-08-06 a primary location took its `subbasin_id` verbatim (`101`, `102`, …)
while any additional location took `1_000_000 + subbasin_id*100 + n` — so a
station and its neighbour sat four orders of magnitude apart in the same column.

| location | before | after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| basin 1, subbasin 1, primary | `101` | `1010` |
| basin 1, subbasin 1, second point | `1010102` | `1011` |
| basin 1, subbasin 2, primary | `102` | `1020` |

**What you have to do.** Both files are keyed by `wflow_id`, so **renumber the
locations file's `wflow_id` column and the discharge file's column headers
together.** Neither failure is silent: a pinned `wflow_id` that no longer matches
the resolved hierarchy stops preparation with an explicit old-ID → resolved-ID
crosswalk, and an observation header carrying ids the registry does not know
fails the WF1 header check by name.

The simplest migration is to **delete the `wflow_id` column**, run WF1 once, and
read the assigned ids out of `data/spatial/location_registry.csv` — the column is
optional, and pinning it is only worth doing when you need the ids to stay fixed
across rebuilds.

`location_code` is unchanged (`B001-S01-L01`): codes are for reading, `wflow_id`
is the integer for joining and for scanning a CSV header.

## `observed_daily_discharge_template.csv`

Observed discharge, **semicolon**-separated — deliberately a different
separator from the locations file; both are read with explicit `sep=`
arguments, so keep each file's separator as shipped.

- First column `time`, ISO-8601 timestamps (`2000-01-01T00:00:00`).
- One further column per station, named by the resolved **`wflow_id`** value in
  `spatial/location_registry.csv` — not by `station_name`.
- Missing values: leave the field empty.

The shipped header (`time;1010;1020`) is illustrative — replace `1010` and `1020`
with your own `wflow_id` values and add one column per station. The two files
must be changed **together**. Before plotting, Workflow 1 checks the raw header
against `spatial/location_registry.csv`: duplicate or unknown IDs fail
explicitly, as does a missing series for any user-provided control or
observation location. Automatically generated outlets may be included but do
not require an observation series.

## What consumes these

The spatial-preparation phase reads gauge points to control subbasin
delineation and writes `spatial/location_registry.csv`. The Wflow adapter then
uses that registry for gauge/output IDs; `plot_results.py` uses the same IDs for
observation joins. A configured path is a declared Snakemake input, so a typo
fails as a missing input instead of silently dropping observation outputs.

## Where they end up

Both files are snapshotted into `<project_dir>/config/basin_data/` by rule
1.01, alongside the run's config (`config/runs/`), catalogs (`config/catalogs/`)
and build templates (`config/templates/`). The bin is named for what it holds —
local, basin-scoped tabular inputs — not for observations alone: only one of the
two files is an observation, the other declares where the model reports. They are referenced by **absolute
path** from wherever you keep them, so without that copy a finished project
could not say what it was evaluated against — the metrics table would cite
gauges and observations that exist only on the machine that ran it.
