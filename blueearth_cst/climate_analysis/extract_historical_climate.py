**model-free**: it comes from ``data/spatial/geoms/region.geojson``, the one
project region artifact delineated from ``shared.basin`` + the catalog by rule
``delineate_region`` (ADR 0003), so nothing here reads a built model.

Until ADR 0003 this script delineated that polygon itself and wrote a
per-store-key copy (``store_region.geojson``). The copy is gone; the store's
extent provenance now travels *in* ``extract_historical.nc`` as the
``region_bbox`` / ``region_geojson_sha256`` / ``region_source`` attributes,
which cannot be separated from the data they describe.

    / ``open_zarr`` as an extra driver kwarg (hydromt's ``DriverOptions`` dumps
    with ``exclude_unset=True``, so an empty dict set explicitly survives).

    The era5 read used to ask for ``"auto"``, reasoning that "we can afford
    larger chunks as we only extract and save". That holds on local disk, where
    over-read is free, and INVERTS over a network store: a dask chunk spanning
    several on-disk chunks drags every one of them across the wire so a basin
    covering one of them can be sliced out.

    Measured 2026-09-18 against ``deltares_data_pdrive.yml`` (era5 as yearly
    global netCDFs on ``p:/``, HDF5 chunks 30x250x480). ``"auto"`` chunked
    60x500x960 -- 2 latitude bands x 2 longitude bands. One year of the seven
    variables over a Gabon bbox, through ``get_rasterdataset``::

        "auto"  2.14 GB  101.8 s        {}  0.55 GB  28.8 s

    3.85x the bytes for the same 5x5 grid. At 17 years that is the 37.5 GB and
    46 min a real extraction spent writing a 76 KB store.

    MEASURE THIS THROUGH ``get_rasterdataset``, NOT ``open_mfdataset`` +
    ``.sel`` -- a probe written the direct way shows the two specs within 4% of
    each other and reads as evidence that the chunking is irrelevant. It is
    not: slicing an opened dataset lets dask fuse the slice into the backend
    read, so only the touched disk chunks move whatever the dask chunk says.
    hydromt applies this source's ``rename`` and ``unit_mult`` between the read
    and the clip, and that elementwise layer is what blocks the fusion -- which
    is precisely why the dask chunk spec governs the transfer on the real path
    and not on a naive one.

    Naming the catalog's own sizes would not be a cure either. era5's
    ``longitude: 240`` SPLITS the stored 480-wide chunk, so two dask tasks each
    want half of one compressed chunk and whether the second one costs a second
    decompression is a question about the HDF5 chunk cache -- which
    ``_bounded_hdf5_chunk_cache`` below deliberately shrinks to 1 MiB, far
    under one 14.4 MB chunk. So under this function's own settings a split spec
    WOULD pay twice, for a basin that straddles the split. Ntoum does not:
    measured 2026-09-18, ``240`` and the encoded ``480`` read the same 0.48 GB.
    ``{}`` makes the question unaskable rather than answered -- the dask chunk
    is the disk chunk by construction -- and it needs no edit to a catalog that
    is vendored upstream-verbatim and hash-pinned.

    An entry the catalog does not carry is skipped rather than invented: the
    caller names every source the extraction MIGHT read, and a chirps-only
    catalog legitimately has no era5.

    If ``clim_source`` is CHIRPS, its precipitation is combined with ERA5
    forcing variables only when ``forcing_required`` is true.

    Parameters
    ----------
    region_fn : str, Path, optional
        Path to the region geojson file. Exactly one of ``region_fn`` and
        ``bbox`` must be provided.
    fn_out : str, Path
        Path to the output netcdf file
    data_libs : str, Path
        Path to the data catalogs yaml file or pre-defined catalogs
    clim_source : str
        Name of the climate source to use
    starttime : str
        Start time of the forcing, format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS
    endtime : str
        End time of the forcing, format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS
    bbox : tuple of float, optional
        Extraction bounds (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax) used instead of the region
        file's total bounds. The rule passes
        ``read_region(...).total_bounds``; ``region_fn`` remains for
        standalone/unit use.
    oro_out : str, Path, optional
        Destination for the chirps/chirps_global orography sidecar. The rule
        passes its declared ``oro_nc`` output (``<store>/orography.nc``) so the
        DAG edge, not a filename convention, carries the DEM/climate
        co-provenance contract. Defaults to the historical
        ``<dirname(fn_out)>/<clim_source>_orography.nc`` when omitted. Ignored
        outside the chirps branch.
    hydrography : str, optional
        Catalog ENTRY NAME of the elevation source the chirps branch reads
        ``elevtn`` from, to reproject onto the precipitation grid and to lapse-
        correct temperature against ``era5_orography``. Defaults to
        ``DEFAULT_HYDROGRAPHY``; the rule passes ``shared.basin.hydrography``,
        which is the same entry the delineation and the model build read.

        It was the hardcoded ``merit_hydro`` until 2026-08-16. That was a source
        NOTHING else in the toolbox names -- ``DEFAULT_HYDROGRAPHY`` is
        ``merit_hydro_ihu`` and the shipped ``setup_basemaps`` agrees -- so the
        chirps branch demanded a staged dataset a working project need not have,
        and failed inside hydromt with a catalog-resolution error that reads as
        a code defect. Reading the CONFIGURED entry also means the DEM behind
        the store is the DEM behind the basin, which is the property that was
        actually wanted. Ignored outside the chirps branch.
    region_sha256 : str, optional
        Content digest of the region artifact the ``bbox`` came from, stamped
        on the extraction as ``region_geojson_sha256`` (ADR 0003).
    region_source : str, Path, optional
        Path of that artifact, stamped as ``region_source``.
    enforce_min_years : bool, optional
        Whether a delivered record below ``MIN_HISTORICAL_YEARS`` is an ERROR
        (default) or a logged warning. ``False`` only for wf0's extra
        ``candidate_sources``, which end at a comparison figure; see
        ``_check_window_coverage``.
    forcing_required : bool, optional
        Whether a precipitation-only source must be enriched with ERA5 and
        orography for WF1/WF3. ``False`` for wf0-only comparison candidates.

    # SYNCHRONOUS, and that is the whole fix for a hard deadlock -- measured
    # 2026-08-18, when wf0 parked forever on the chirps store at 94.2%.
    #
    # netCDF4/HDF5 takes a PROCESS-GLOBAL lock and xarray serializes every
    # netCDF touch through it. Under the threaded scheduler this graph asks for
    # that lock from both directions at once: the `to_netcdf` write tasks
    # (`netCDF4_.py::__setitem__`) and the source's own read tasks
    # (`netCDF4_.py::_getitem`) run in the SAME pool, so writers and readers
    # each hold one sub-lock of a `CombinedLock` while waiting for the other and
    # nobody is left making progress. A py-spy dump shows every worker parked at
    # `xarray/backends/locks.py:66` with the process burning 0.08 s of CPU per
    # 20 s of wall clock -- a deadlock, not a slow write.
    #
    # It is SOURCE-SHAPED, which is why it stayed hidden: under
    # `deltares_data.yml` era5 reads from `era5_daily.zarr`, zarr takes no such
    # lock, and that store writes in seconds. chirps reads 17 yearly
    # `CHIRPS_rainfall_{year}.nc` plus `era5_orography_2018.nc` for the lapse
    # correction -- netCDF on both sides of one graph, so under THAT catalog the
    # deadlock is reachable only there.
    #
    # BEING SOURCE-SHAPED IS NOT THE SAME AS BEING CHIRPS-SHAPED, and reading
    # this as "only chirps needs the synchronous scheduler" is the mistake the
    # paragraph above invites. `deltares_data_pdrive.yml` -- hydromt's own
    # catalog against the Deltares network store, which this repo vendors --
    # points era5 at yearly global netCDFs instead (`meteo/era5_daily/nc_merged/
    # era5_{year}_daily.nc`, confirmed 2026-09-18). That is netCDF on both sides
    # again, so under that catalog the era5 path would be deadlock-REACHABLE the
    # moment anyone reintroduced a threaded scheduler here.
    #
    # It has never deadlocked, and nothing below is fixing a live fault: the
    # deadlock needs read and write tasks contending over `CombinedLock` in one
    # pool, and `scheduler="synchronous"` leaves no pool to contend in. The
    # point is only that "era5 is safe because it reads zarr" is a catalog's
    # property, not this function's to assume -- so the scheduler stays
    # synchronous for EVERY source.
    #
    # The same failure is diagnosed in bf1f4a5 and worked around at three WF2
    # call sites by materializing the READ eagerly (`.load()`) before writing.
    # That fix would be wrong here: those sites load small per-member summaries,
    # whereas this is the climate store itself, whose size is set by the basin
    # and the historical window and is bounded by nothing in this function.
    # Eager would trade a deadlock for an OOM on a large basin. Going
    # synchronous removes the concurrency the lock contends over while still
    # streaming chunk by chunk, so peak memory is unchanged.
    #
    # THAT LAST CLAUSE WAS CHALLENGED AND HELD, 2026-09-18. A 2026-09-18
    # extraction showed resident memory tracking bytes read almost 1:1, which
    # read as evidence that this graph accumulates and that an eager read with
    # a size guard would be both faster and safer. It is not: over 2000..2002
    # the shipped path peaked at 1578 MB, an eager read at 1596 and a read with
    # no write at all at 1570. The growth was never in this graph -- it was the
    # per-variable HDF5 chunk cache on the READ side, now bounded by
    # `_bounded_hdf5_chunk_cache` above. Streaming stays, and the size argument
    # against eager stands untouched.
    #
    # Cost is one core on a zlib-bound write. `DaskProgress` is unaffected:
    # `dask.local.get_sync` drives the same callback machinery, so the bar
    # still renders (verified, not assumed).
    #
    # Set through `dask.config` rather than passed as `compute(scheduler=...)`
    # so the call signature stays what every caller and fake already expects,
    # and so any compute nested inside `to_netcdf` inherits it too.
