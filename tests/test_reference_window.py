"""Reference-window clip and warning tests for step 5e (design §5.4 D1).

The seed config exercises **none** of the warning paths — `[1990, 2010]` needs no
clip, is exactly 20 years, and differs from `shared.historical_window` in the way
that must stay off stderr. So every condition D1 names lives here, not in the tree
diff. Falsifiers K3–K6 of `dev/milestones/r08/2026-07-30_wf2-5e-falsifier.md`.
