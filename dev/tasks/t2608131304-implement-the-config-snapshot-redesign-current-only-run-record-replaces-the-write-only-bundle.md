> [!note] Overview
> **What** — Replace the content-addressed config bundle with a current-only run record that stays fresh when the toolbox moves, records post-normalization hydromt values, and copies only what the repo cannot give back.
> **Why** — The bundle has zero readers and an imprecise digest; R3's 'actual values used' is satisfied today only by an unprotected debug log; and the toolbox revision is recorded only by the wrapper, so a direct snakemake run records nothing.
> **Effort** — large. Seven phases, most in `lane/pipeline`; design accepted, so this is execution, not scoping.

## The design is accepted — do not re-derive it

`dev/working/2026-08-13_config-snapshot/`:

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `design-v3.md` | the accepted design (831 lines) |
| `master.task.md` | program brief: subsystem map, sequencing, gates |
| `p0…p7-*.task.md` | one brief per phase, each independently verifiable |
| `driver-verification.md` | facts checked in-tree, incl. a reviewer tie-break |
| `review-{gpt,fable}-r2.md`, `review-ledger-r1.md` | the review record |

Two external review rounds (GPT `gpt-5.6-sol` and Fable, independent, same
brief) returned `revise` on both v1 and v2; the owner invoked arbitration at
the round cap and Fable authored v3. **No further design review** — the next
artifact is code.

## What the reviews actually caught

The recurring defect had one shape: the design kept specifying a **field**
where a **trigger** was needed. Worth carrying into implementation, because
the same mistake is available at every step.

- **Rule X.01's rerun triggers do not include toolbox identity**, so a
  code-only commit left the record stamped with the previous commit and wrote
  no journal line. Both reviewers found this independently. Fixed by two
  complementary mechanisms — params threading refreshes the record when the
  checkout moves; lifecycle hooks record invocations that execute nothing.
- **The values-used record must serialize POST-normalization kwargs.**
  `build_wflow_model.py:237-268` pops configured args and derives
  `lulc_mapping_fn` at call time, so serializing the template records the
  wrong thing. The reviewers disagreed here; code broke the tie
  (`driver-verification.md`). The decisive case is that function's own comment
  about CORINE read through `vito_mapping_default` — *"Wrong numbers, not a
  missing setting."*
- **The journal must never be a declared output** — Snakemake deletes declared
  outputs before a job runs, so it would truncate to one line every run,
  silently. A one-line journal looks exactly like a young journal.
- **Production carries no `.git`** (the Dockerfile ADDs sources individually),
  so every identity mechanism needs a degraded mode.

## Correction to the design, binding on P4

Design §6 proposes rules `1.16`/`3.17`. **Both are taken** — WF1
`1.16 gather_benchmarks` / `1.17 gather_logs`, WF3 `3.17` / `3.18` the same
pair. Use **`1.15b`** and **`3.16b`**, before the gather rules, per
`dev/reference/naming.md` §8b ("DO NOT RENUMBER TO INSERT A RULE").

## Progress

Sequencing and blocking edges are in `master.task.md`; this is the surface.

- [x] **P0** — probe Snakemake lifecycle handlers on the pinned version.
      Done 2026-08-13, `p0-probe-result.md`. **Gate 1 TRIPPED — stopped.**
      On Snakemake 9.6.2 a "Nothing to be done" no-op fires *no* handler:
      `workflow.py:1375-1377` returns before `_onstart`, unguarded by any flag.
      Hooks therefore cover only invocations in which ≥1 job executed — the set
      params threading already covers — so R5's "record every invocation" is
      unmet exactly where it was needed. Awaiting an owner decision on the
      journal mechanism; P1–P3 are unaffected and can proceed.
- [x] **P1** — `shared/provenance.py`: projection document, two digests,
      `toolbox_identity()`, `environment_file_hashes()`,
      `append_journal_line()`. Landed `906bd69`.
      `projection` defaults to `None` (whole config) rather than being
      required: the two pre-existing callers acquire theirs in P2 and P4, and
      each phase has to leave the tree working on its own. The default is the
      safe direction — over-inclusive, so noisy rather than blind.
- [x] **P2** — `copy_config_files.py`: bundle removed, `run_record.yml`,
      R4 per-file predicate, collision refusal. Landed `4d4243a` + `3a1d270`.
      **Carries P4's checklist item 1** (drop `CONFIG_SNAPSHOT_DIR` and the
      `snapshot_bundle` output from all three Snakefiles), pulled forward on an
      owner ruling — without it every workflow fails at its FIRST rule with
      `MissingOutputException` for the whole time P4 stays blocked.
- [x] **P3** — values-used records from rules 1.07 and 1.08. Landed `27754cd`
      + `61d38d7`, after defect H's remainder cleared the collision in
      `_apply_parameter_steps` (that item is now closed; see `dev/LOG.md`).
      Each step's call kwargs are built ONCE and consumed twice — unwrapped for
      hydromt, rendered for the record. The three falsifiers were written
      before the refactor and observed to fail first.
- [x] **P4** — Snakefile wiring: projections, parse-time digests, params
      threading, hooks, rules `1.15b`/`3.16b`. Landed `197fbd2`.
      Two defects found while wiring and fixed in the same commit:
      `_reference_identity` fell back to `role` (a CLASS several references
      share) before `origin`, collapsing two pathless catalogs into one digest
      term; and a `script:` target may not carry `from __future__ import
      annotations`, which the repo's own contract tests caught.
- [x] **P5** — both halves: `.gitignore` `e006e34` (devmeta), `Dockerfile`
      `ARG TOOLBOX_COMMIT` `74861d1` (pipeline). The Docker BUILD was not run —
      the brief excludes it from this phase's gate.
- [x] **P7** — `README.md` + `AGENTS.md` `1baa472` (devmeta); the in-project
      `config/runs/README.md` writer `40c2b11` (pipeline).
- [x] **P6** — cleanup tool + tree inventory + fixture. Landed `a0e6356`
      (tool + inventory), `14d3cca` (tests), `4a4b0a5` (dead prefix).
      **Gate 2 passed 2026-08-13**: the owner reviewed the dry-run list and
      approved all 10 items, plus a one-off removal of a stale copy of a
      shipped default.
      Results, both recorded as the brief requires:
      **`tree-check` 45 unmapped → `MAP CLEAN`, 0 unmapped.** Every one of the
      45 was bundle content and nothing else, so the transition is exactly the
      migration and not a coincidence.
      **`check_baseline.py check` → `OK - 7 target(s) match manifest`.** The
      falsifier for the design's no-re-record claim did not fire.
      `pixi run test-fast` in the PRIMARY, against the cleaned fixture:
      2119 passed, 0 failures.
      The dry-run found one thing the design did not predict: the inventory
      still declared `experiments/<id>/config/runs/`, so the experiment's
      bundle stayed green while its WF1/WF2 siblings correctly went red. A
      prefix that outlives its writer is how an orphan goes unreported.

## Before starting

**`lane/pipeline` was claimed 2026-08-13T03:10** by another session (config
defects, [[t2608130215-fix-the-confirmed-config-defects-found-by-the-dual-parameter-review]]).
Check `.lane-claim` and report if still held — nearly all of this lands there.

That item's **defect H** touches the same function P3 refactors
(`_apply_parameter_steps`), and its `lulc` half already landed in `b31b9a3`.
Land H's remainder first or accept the conflict; do not run them concurrently.

  that bin rather than renaming it, so the rename had nothing left to rename.
