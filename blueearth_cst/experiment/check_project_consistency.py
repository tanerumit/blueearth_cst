"""wf3 startup drift guard: experiment config vs project snapshots.

An experiment config is a *full* config (approach A). Its project-level
sections (``project``, ``shared.basin``, ``workflows.model_creation``,
``workflows.climate_projections``) must describe the same project the built
model / overlay came from — otherwise the experiment silently reuses a
``hydrology_model/`` built under different settings. This rule (3.00b
``check_project_consistency``) runs at wf3 rule time and fails loud on
divergence, naming the diverging key.

Design: dev/p31/experiment-structure-design.md §3/§3a/§3b/§3d.

The comparator core (``compare_project_consistency``) is a PURE function of the
live config dict + snapshot paths (gate 2 a–h call it directly on staged
config/snapshot pairs with no Snakemake). The ``if "snakemake" in globals()``
harness wires it to the rule; the parse-time digest params (a separate rerun-
trigger layer, gate 2b) live in the Snakefile, not here.

NOTE: no ``from __future__`` import here — Snakemake's ``script:`` runner
prepends a preamble to the script file, so a ``__future__`` import would no
longer be the first statement and raises ``SyntaxError`` at rule time.
