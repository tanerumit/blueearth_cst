"""The thematic map family drawn from ``data/spatial/spatial_maps.nc``.

``basin_area`` shows one layer of the spatial foundation — elevation. This
module draws the rest of the set: the delineation, land cover, leaf area and the
soil profile, each through the SAME cartographic template, so a basin report is
one visual family rather than ten unrelated pictures.

:func:`plot_spatial_figure_set` draws BOTH — it is rule 1.12's entry point, and
the two halves are one deliverable rather than two that happen to share a
folder. See its docstring.

Three things live here and deliberately not in ``shared.cartographic_map``:

* the **layer registry** (:data:`SPATIAL_MAP_FIGURES`) — which variables get a
  figure, in what order, under what filename;
* the **styles**, because they name data sources. The template's docstring says
  nothing in it knows what wflow is; by the same rule nothing in it should know
  what SoilGrids or Copernicus are. ``RASTER_STYLES`` holds the source-neutral
  quantities (elevation, precipitation, temperature, PET); a family tied to
  specific products holds its own;
* the **class tables** for the nominal layers, taken from the source product's
  published legend where one exists.

Two things every figure here does NOT have, and both are deliberate:

* **no title.** The colourbar label or the class legend already names the
  quantity, and a title over the map costs panel height on every sheet. The
  FILENAME is what names the figure, which is why the stems read as the
  quantity (``soil_ph_topsoil``) rather than as a position in a set. The one
  thing the title did carry and a filename cannot — the product credit — moved
  to a footnote under the axes; see :data:`SOURCE_CREDITS`.
* **no overlay key.** Rivers, the basin outline, the divides and the points of
  interest are still DRAWN — that is what ties ten rasters to one basin — but
  they get no legend entries. ``basin_area``, in this same folder, carries the
  key that explains them once; repeating it ten times spends the panel height
  the land-cover legend needs and teaches a reader nothing after the first sheet.

What is NOT drawn, and why, is as much a decision as what is:

* ``elevation`` — it is ``basin_area.png``, which lands in this same folder.
  Drawing it twice under two names would put two different-looking figures of
  one quantity in front of a reader.
* ``slope``, ``upstream_area``, ``river_order`` — drawn in the first draft and
  cut on review (owner's call, 2026-08-10): terrain derivatives a first-order
  basin assessment does not read, where ``basin_area`` already carries the
  relief and the river layer already carries the network.
* ``flow_accumulation`` — proportional to ``upstream_area`` (the cells are
  equal-area to within 0.002% here), so it is the same map in different units.
* ``river_mask`` — the river vector layer already draws it, on every figure.
* ``flow_direction`` — D8 codes are CYCLIC, not ordinal and not really nominal
  either; a useful QA raster, not a report figure.
* anything CONSTANT over the basin — ``basin_id`` on a single-parent project,
  ``cell_area``, and ``soil_soilthickness`` where the source is flat. Skipped at
  RENDER time with a printed reason rather than by an exclusion list, because
  which layers are degenerate depends on the basin, not on the code.

Soil is drawn at the TOPSOIL slice (``sl1``, 0-5 cm) only. SoilGrids ships seven
depth slices of six properties; forty-two near-identical maps is not a
deliverable, and the topsoil is the slice that governs infiltration and the
land-surface exchange this toolbox is built around. A deeper slice is one
registry entry away.

**No ``from __future__ import annotations`` here**, and none may be added:
Snakemake PREPENDS a preamble to a ``script:`` module, so the future import is
no longer at the top of the file and the job dies with SyntaxError before
running a line. It costs nothing on the pinned Python — PEP 585 and 604
annotations are native — and ``tests/test_model_reference.py`` enforces it.

# is imported inside that function.
#
# The two module-scope imports below are what the DECLARATIONS in this file
# need, and both are cheap:

#: Codes AND colours are the product's own (Buchhorn et al. 2020; the table
#: published with CGLS-LC100, reproduced in the Earth Engine catalog entry).
#: They are not a palette choice and must not be "improved": a reader who knows
#: the product recognises this map at a glance, which no ramp of ours can buy,
#: and the same basin drawn here and in any other CGLS map then matches.
#:
#: All 23 classes are declared even though a single basin carries a handful —
#: ``category_entries`` drops the absent ones from the legend, and an undeclared
#: code would be drawn grey and warned about. Declaring the whole legend is what
#: keeps that warning meaning "the source changed", not "this basin is elsewhere".
#:
#: Labels are shortened from the product's sentence-long definitions, and the
#: twelve forest classes WRAP onto two lines. The side panel is about 40 mm
#: wide and the legend does not participate in constrained layout, so a label
#: longer than that does not widen the panel — it runs off the page, which is

#: are unchanged, so the mapping back to the product stays checkable.

# the pixi env and would be a new dependency for a figure family.
#
# The rule applied throughout: take the SOURCE PRODUCT's own legend where it has
# one (land cover), otherwise the discipline's convention (green = vegetation,
# brown = organic matter), otherwise a neutral ramp rather than a hue that would
# assert something the data does not say.

#: Vegetation density. Green is the one hue a reader will not misread here.
LEAF_AREA_INDEX_STYLE = RasterStyle(

#: The three particle-size fractions SHARE one ramp on purpose. They are the
#: same quantity — mass % of the same fine-earth total, summing to 100 — so a
#: reader compares the three maps directly, and a different hue per fraction
#: would say they are different kinds of thing. Red-orange is the mineral family
#: the USDA texture triangle already puts clay in.
TEXTURE_PALETTE = "OrRd"

#: Organic carbon. Pale straw to dark brown is the SOC convention (ISRIC's own
#: legends, the FAO GSOCmap), and it is the one soil property whose colour
#: meaning is genuinely established.
#:
#: MASS PERCENT, not the source's raw integers. SoilGrids 2017 stores ORCDRC in
#: g/kg and the catalog's ``unit_mult`` of 0.1 converts it on read, which is the
#: unit ``hydromt_wflow.workflows.ptf`` documents its pedotransfer functions as
#: taking ("organic carbon [%]"). Checked rather than inferred from the range —

#: plausible.
ORGANIC_CARBON_STYLE = RasterStyle(

#: Soil pH, on whichever of two encodings the basin earns.
#:
#: pH 7 is a PHYSICAL midpoint — acid below, alkaline above — which is what
#: licenses a diverging ramp, and ``RdYlBu`` puts acid in red and alkaline in
#: blue, the near-universal soil convention. But it is only honest for a basin
#: that reaches both sides: one running 4.7-5.5 has no alkaline ground, so an
#: absolute ramp would spend half its colours on values that do not occur and
#: flatten the real variation into two classes.
#:
#: So the midpoint is DECLARED and activated per raster
#: (``resolve_diverging_style``). A basin spanning pH 7 gets the diverging map
#: with white pinned to neutral; a one-sided basin keeps ``YlGnBu``, pale (more
#: acidic) to dark blue-green (less), which runs in the same direction as the
#: convention without claiming a midpoint the data does not contain.
