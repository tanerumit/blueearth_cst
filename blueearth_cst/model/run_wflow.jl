# Rule 1.14's driver: run the Wflow.jl model once, on historical forcing.
#
# Rule 1.14 invoked Wflow through Julia's `-e` flag until now:
#
#     julia ... -e "using Wflow; Wflow.run()" "<toml>"
#
# which is the invocation Wflow's own docstring suggests, and which emits
# NOTHING to the console for the whole run under `[logging] silent = true` --
# the longest single step in WF1, reduced to the tee's 60-second "still running"
# heartbeat. This driver exists to give it the same progress bar every other
# long step in the toolbox animates; see `shared/wflow_progress.jl` for why the
# fraction has to be reported from here and rendered on the Python side.
#
# WHY A FILE RATHER THAN A LONGER `-e`. The logger wiring is ~20 lines and is
# shared with rule 3.15, so `-e` would mean either duplicating it in two
# Snakefile string literals or shipping it as an unreadable one-liner. A file
# is also what 3.15 already does (`experiment/run_wflow_batch.jl`), so the two
# Wflow-running rules now have the same shape.
#
# NO BATCH COUNTER HERE. 3.15's rows carry `[k/N]` because a batch runs several
# members; 1.14 runs exactly one, and `[1/1]` would be noise. The bar is the
# progress signal, and the rule banner already names the step.

# what puts a line on the console for it.
