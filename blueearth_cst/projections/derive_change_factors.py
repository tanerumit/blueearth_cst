"""Stage B — all change factors in ONE job (migration step 4d, design §8).

Replaces the pair `monthly_change` (fanned out per `point_key` × horizon) and
`monthly_change_scalar_merge` (a single aggregator over their `temp()` outputs).
The design's rule table gives stage B **1 job** with no fan-out
(`dev/milestones/r08/wf2-climate-analysis-v2-design.md` §5, "B. Derive"), reading the explicit
expanded series list.

**This step is value-neutral by construction.** The arithmetic is not reimplemented
here: `get_change_annual_clim_proj` and
`summary_climate_proj` are imported from the two modules that already held them,
unchanged. Only the orchestration moves. A non-zero characterized diff on the
summary artifacts is therefore a defect in this file, not a judgement call — which
is the whole reason the functions were left where they were.

What changes shape:

* the per-point `annual_change_scalar_stats-{point_key}_{horizon}.nc` files were
  Snakemake `temp()` outputs and are now **job-internal intermediates** with the
  same lifetime — written, consumed by the merge, removed. `summary_climate_proj`
  reads model/scenario/horizon from dataset *coords*, never from the filename, so
  relocating them is safe (checked before the move, not assumed);
* one log and one benchmark instead of a per-part tree under `2.04_monthly_change/`.

Stage B's input set is explicit (design risk-06 / revision 4): the rule declares
exactly the expanded `{series_key}` list built from the resolved combination set,
and this job **asserts that the set it opened equals that list**. A model removed
from the config cannot rejoin the run through a leftover file in `scalar/`.

Invoked from ``analyze_projections.smk`` via ``script:``; reads
``snakemake.input/output/params``, never ``sys.argv``.
