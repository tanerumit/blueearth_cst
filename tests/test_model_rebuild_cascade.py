"""R7-1: re-firing build_wflow_model must rebuild the TOML-writing chain.

`models/hydrology/wflow/wflow_sbm.toml` is CREATED by rule 1.03 `build_wflow_model` and then
updated IN PLACE by rules 1.04-1.08 (waterbodies, gauges/outputs, runtime,
forcing) -- but only 1.03 declares it. Before this fix, anything that re-fired
1.03 alone left the toml stripped of every section the later rules add, and the
next wflow run died on the missing key. It bit three times during the R7
milestone; each recovery needed --forceall.

The obvious fix -- dropping the `ancient()` on staticmaps in 1.04/1.05 -- is
WRONG, and this module pins why: those rules commit writes back into
staticmaps.nc themselves (`mod.write()` / `mod.close()`), so a plain input edge
would make each re-trigger on its own execution forever.
