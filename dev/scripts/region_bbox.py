"""Report — and optionally write — the bounding box of the project's region.

**Why this exists rather than reading the model.** The built Wflow tree already
carries a rectangle at ``models/hydrology/wflow/staticgeoms/region.geojson``,
but that file is hydromt's, not ours: ``WflowStaticmapsComponent`` hardcodes
``region_component=None``, so ``Model.region`` resolves to
``GridComponent._region_data`` — ``box(*self.bounds)`` — and the value is
whatever a hydromt release decides "region" means for a grid model. Depending on
it also means depending on a MODEL BUILD, which WF0 deliberately does not do.

Measured on both fixtures, the Wflow grid's bounds ARE the basin's
``total_bounds`` to floating-point equality (max delta 3.3e-16), so deriving the
box here loses nothing. It gains a little: the grid in ``staticmaps.nc`` is
exact, but the ``staticgeoms/region.geojson`` written beside it carries
6-decimal coordinates — ~3.3e-7 degrees off the true corner. This script's own
write round-trips at zero, and ``hydromt.writers.write_region`` is a plain
``gdf.to_file`` with no precision argument, so that residual is the coordinate
precision of the file as written rather than a different rectangle.

Reads ``data/spatial/geoms/region.geojson`` — the delineated basin, and the one
project region artifact (ADR 0003) — never the model's ``staticgeoms/``. That
direction is the repo's stance, not this script's preference:
``blueearth_cst/spatial/delineate_region.py`` states the same rule for the
extraction ("never from a built model's ``staticmaps.nc`` or
``staticgeoms/region.geojson``").

**Prints by default; writes only with ``--out``.** The box is a derived value,
so seeing it is usually the whole need and nothing is written unless asked.
Where a built model happens to be present its rectangle is compared, so the
agreement is visible — but the model is optional and its absence is not an
error, which is what keeps this usable on a model-free WF0 project.

Usage (from the repo root, inside pixi)::

    python dev/scripts/region_bbox.py --config test_case/project_config_rapid.yml
    python dev/scripts/region_bbox.py --config <cfg> --out
    python dev/scripts/region_bbox.py --config <cfg> --out some/where/bbox.geojson

Not part of a run: this inspects a project tree
(see AGENTS.md, "Three homes for executables").
