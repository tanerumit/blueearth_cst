"""Spherical cell-area weights from midpoint edges (design D10, step 5a).

The spatial reduction was an unweighted ``mean([x_dim, y_dim])``, which treats a
cell near 60°N as equal in area to one at the equator. design-v2/v3 proposed
cos-latitude weighting behind a "1-D and strictly monotonic" geometry check;
round-2 review (ext2-02) faulted that pair, and the fault is worth restating
because it shapes this module:

    cos(lat) is a valid area weight only for *uniformly spaced* rectilinear
    grids, and "1-D + strictly monotonic" does not test spacing. A Gaussian grid
    passes the check and receives wrong weights — silently.

Revision 4 does not strengthen the check to match the scheme. It changes the
scheme so that **its validity condition is exactly the condition the check
tests**: each cell is weighted by the true spherical area implied by its edges,

    w = (sin φ_north − sin φ_south) × Δλ

with edges derived from adjacent-center midpoints. Midpoint derivation consumes
exactly one property — ordered, distinct 1-D centers — which is precisely what the
check establishes. No spacing assumption remains.

Two consequences worth knowing before editing:

* **This is a strict generalization, not a competitor.** On any uniformly spaced
  grid these weights are *exactly* proportional to cos φ, because
  ``sin(φ+d/2) − sin(φ−d/2) = 2·sin(d/2)·cos φ`` and the constant factor cancels in
  a weighted mean. Anything that breaks that equivalence is a bug in the edges, not
  a modelling choice (falsifier F1).
* **The residual approximation is a different, smaller one.** True cell edges are
  not always adjacent-center midpoints — a Gaussian grid's conventional edges
  differ slightly. Exact edges are unavailable here: the generated catalog sets
  ``drop_variables: [time_bnds, lat_bnds, lon_bnds, bnds]`` on every CMIP6 entry.
  So the residual is "true edges vs midpoints", not "cos φ vs area".

Falsifiers for every claim above: ``dev/records/milestones/r08/2026-07-30_wf2-5a-falsifier.md``.
