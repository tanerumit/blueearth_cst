"""Which cells of a climate grid a polygon covers, and the masks built from it.

ONE definition of "the cells inside this geometry", used wherever a gridded
climate field is reduced to a per-area series: the basin average and the
per-subbasin averages behind WF0's figures.

**The predicate is INTERSECTS on the cell's own box**, not a centre-in-polygon
test, and that is inherited rather than invented — ``extract_historical_climate.
write_basin_cell_mask`` established it for the file weathergenr averages over,
with the reason recorded there: a basin smaller than one ERA5 cell contains NO
cell centre, so a centre test picks zero cells exactly on the small basins CST
exists for. A subbasin is smaller than its basin by construction, so the
argument only gets stronger here.

Every selected cell counts EQUALLY (owner ruling 2026-08-10, same origin). No
fractional-area weighting: a cell either meets the polygon or it does not.

**Why this is not imported from ``extract_historical_climate``.** That module is
rule 0.04's ``script:``, and Snakemake hashes a script's file content to decide
whether the rule is stale — so editing it to export a helper re-fires every
extraction in every project tree, and in ``test_case/test_local`` that cascades
through the model build. The duplication is one function's worth and it is
deliberate; unifying the two belongs to the producer fix already planned on
``dev/tasks/t2608161450``, which edits that file anyway.
