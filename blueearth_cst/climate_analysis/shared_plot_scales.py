"""One plotting scale per variable per figure kind, shared across sources.

Rule ``derive_plot_scales``'s script (``analyze_climate.smk`` 0.04b). WF0 draws
one figure set per candidate source, each in its own job, so without this no two
of those figures share an axis: a reader comparing ERA5's precipitation map with
CHIRPS's would be comparing two different colour ramps and could not see a
difference that is actually there. This module reads every candidate's store,
pools the values each figure would plot, and writes the boundaries all of them
then draw against.

**Why this is not the sidecar retired on 2026-08-16.** That one shared a scale
between the SOURCE and FORCING families, and it was retired because the two frame
different footprints -- a bar classified on a raster-framed extraction is wrong
for a basin-cropped forcing field (``climate_figures.MAP_EXTENT``). This shares a
scale between two SOURCES, which are both raster-framed extractions over the same
bbox plus buffer. The objection does not transfer; the mechanism
(``cartographic_map.RasterStyle.levels``) is the same one, and its docstring
already describes this use.

**The resolution difference is a finding, not noise to normalise away.** ERA5 at
0.25 degrees against CHIRPS at 0.05 degrees means the coarser grid averages over
more area and damps its own extremes. A shared bar makes that visible, which is
the point. Nothing here rescales a dataset to make the panels agree.

    variables : sequence of str
        The variables to derive scales for. A variable is only pooled across the
        stores that actually CARRY it -- a precipitation-only source contributes
        to ``precip`` and to nothing else, which is what keeps its borrowed era5
        fields out of a scale as surely as it keeps them out of a figure.
    anchor : str
        Water-year resample anchor, as the figures use.
    basin_cells : mapping, optional
        ``{source_name: basin_cells.csv}``. The SERIES kinds are pooled over the
        basin's cells, because that is what rule 0.05 now draws -- a scale
        computed over the buffered extraction and applied to a basin mean is

        The ``map`` kind is pooled UNMASKED, and that is not an oversight: the
