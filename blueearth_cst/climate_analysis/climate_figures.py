"""ONE canonical climate figure set, applied to every gridded climate dataset.

WF1 holds two gridded climate products and until now each had its own plotting
code and its own idea of what a climate figure is:

=====================  =========================================  ==============
Dataset (``dataset``)  Home                                       Producer
=====================  =========================================  ==============
``source``             ``data/climate/historical/<key>/plots/``   rule 1.15
``forcing``            ``models/hydrology/wflow/forcing/plots/``  rule 1.13
=====================  =========================================  ==============

They are the SAME climate at two stages — raw on the extraction grid, and
downscaled/corrected onto the model grid — so the useful question is what
changed between them. That question is unanswerable while the two are drawn
differently, which is why this module exists: identical figures, identical
aggregation, identical layout, differing only in the data and the label. The
redundancy is deliberate and cheap (these are aggregations of arrays already in
memory).

The set is a CROSS-PRODUCT, ``variable x kind``, and both axes are meant to
grow. Adding a kind is one entry in ``FIGURE_KINDS`` plus its branch in
``_render``; adding a variable is one entry in ``CLIMATE_VARS``. Because the
product is config-invariant, ``figure_names()`` lets the Snakefile DECLARE every
figure (O-24) instead of writing some of them invisibly — keep it that way when
extending, or the new figures become undeclared outputs.

Deliberately plain matplotlib: no cartopy basemap tiles, so neither rule needs
NETWORK access. Rule 1.13 used ``cartopy.io.img_tiles.QuadtreeTiles`` before
this module and therefore made a live tile request mid-workflow; the basin/river
context it bought is available offline through ``overlays`` (drawn from the
model's own geometries) and, at higher fidelity, from rule 1.12's
``basin_area.png``.

A third climate-figure family — the model-parity plots under
``models/hydrology/wflow/evaluation/plots/`` (rule 1.11) — is NOT part of this
set. It answers a different question (per-subcatchment climate as the model sees
it, beside the discharge it produced) and is keyed by station rather than by
grid.

#: summed temperature is meaningless and a meaned rainfall understates by ~365x.
#:
#: **Re-exported, not defined here** (R14 `C-57`). The same three variables were
#: also described by every project's `variables:` block, in a second vocabulary
#: that knew nothing about this one; `shared/variable_registry.py` is now the
#: single record and this is its presentation view. The name and the value are
#: unchanged, including insertion order, so every reader of this module is
#: untouched. `C-49` -- getting the table out of Python altogether -- is a
#: separate row and stays outside this phase.
CLIMATE_VARS = _CLIMATE_VARS

#: One entry per figure kind. ``map`` is the spatial view (climatological
#: field), ``annual`` and ``monthly`` are the temporal views (domain mean).
FIGURE_KINDS = ("map", "annual", "monthly")

#: Datasets this set is applied to. The key is the filename prefix AND the
#: title, so a figure copied out of its directory still says what it is -- the
#: reason the source figures carried a ``source_`` prefix before this module,
#: now applied to both sides so the two directories are directly comparable.
DATASETS = {
    "source": "source grid (raw extraction)",
    "forcing": "model grid (wflow forcing)",
}

#: How each family FRAMES its maps, and it is not the same answer for both.
#:
#: ``"basin"`` crops to the basin's bounding box; ``"raster"`` shows the field's
#: own full footprint. The forcing is masked to the basin, so for it the two are
#: nearly the same box and ``"basin"`` is simply the tidier one.
#:
#: The SOURCE side has been both, and is BACK on ``"basin"`` as of 2026-08-17
#: (owner's ruling), reversing the 2026-08-16 ruling that had moved it to
#: ``"raster"`` the day before. Both directions are recorded here because the
#: trade is real and neither answer is free.
#:
#: ``"raster"`` was chosen because a raw extraction is a handful of reanalysis
#: cells reaching well past the catchment — at ERA5's 0.25 degrees a small basin
#: sits inside one or two of them — so cropping to the basin shows a single flat
#: class and calls it a map of the climate. Measured on the rapid fixture: the
#: whole era5 extraction is 4x5 cells and the basin is 0.200 x 0.133 degrees,
#: under one cell wide.
#:
#: ``"basin"`` is chosen anyway, because the question the figure pair answers is
#: what downscaling changed, and that comparison needs both families framed on
#: the same footprint. A flat source panel is then INFORMATION — it says the
#: source grid does not resolve this basin — rather than a defect of the figure.
#: On a fine source (CHIRPS at 0.05 degrees) the same frame is genuinely
#: informative.
#:
#: Two consequences, both live:
#:
#: * ``_raster_within`` crops the field to the frame before the colourbar
#:   classifies it, so the bar describes what is shown. That already existed for
#:   the caller-supplied-extent path and is what makes this switch safe.
#: * wf0's shared scale (rule 0.04b, ``climate_levels.json``) is pooled from the
#:   FULL stores, so it now describes a wider footprint than any source panel
#:   draws. The scale stays comparable ACROSS sources, which is its job, but it
#:   is no longer the range of the drawn cells.

# other. It went with the extent ruling above (see MAP_EXTENT). Once the two
# families frame different footprints a shared bar is not a convenience but a
# defect — it would be classified on the source extraction and applied to a
# basin-cropped forcing field, so the forcing map would spend most of its ramp
# on values that occur only outside the catchment. Each family now classifies
# what it actually draws.
#
# What this gave up, stated plainly: the two maps of a variable no longer share
# a scale, so a source/forcing difference can no longer be read off the colours
# alone. Rules 1.05 and 1.13 lost the DAG edge that carried the file.

    """Write the canonical figure set for one gridded climate dataset.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ds : xr.Dataset
        Gridded climate carrying every key of :data:`CLIMATE_VARS` on a
        ``time`` + spatial grid. A PLAIN dataset on purpose: the raw side has no
        model to load and the forcing side has already loaded one, so the model
        coupling stays in the callers and this function stays testable without a
        model (the P4 property ``tests/test_plot_climate_source.py`` pins).
    plot_dir : str | Path
        Destination directory. Created if absent.
    dataset : str
        A key of :data:`DATASETS` — the filename prefix and the subtitle.
    caveat : str, optional
        Footnote rendered on every figure, so it survives the file being copied
        out of its directory.
    overlays : dict, optional
        ``{"basins": gdf, "rivers": gdf, ...}`` drawn on the MAP figures only.
        Absent or empty entries are skipped, so a caller without a model simply
        passes nothing.
    clim_source : str, optional
        The source id. Present ⇒ the SOURCE family, named under the WF0 grammar
        with this as the ``dataset_scope``; absent ⇒ the legacy
        ``<dataset>_<var>_<kind>.png`` spelling the forcing family keeps.
    area_masks : mapping, optional
        ``{spatial_scope: mask_or_None}`` for the AGGREGATED kinds — typically
        ``{"basin_avg": <basin mask>}`` plus one entry per subbasin. Each mask
        restricts the domain mean to that area's cells; ``None`` means the full
        extraction, which is what a caller with no basin geometry gets. The map
        kind ignores this entirely: it draws the field, not a reduction of it.
    subbasin_dir : str | Path, optional
        Where the per-subbasin figures land. They are written to their own
        directory because their COUNT is a property of the delineation and so is
        unknown when the Snakefile declares its outputs — the rule declares this
        directory instead, which is the same trade rule 1.15 records for its
        per-station figures. Defaults to ``plot_dir``.

    Returns
    -------
    list[Path]
        The figures written, in :func:`source_figure_names` order for the source
        family and :func:`figure_names` order for the forcing one.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``dataset`` is unknown or ``ds`` lacks a variable. Loud on purpose:
        the rules declare these figures, so a silent skip would resurface as an
        opaque ``MissingOutputException`` at the end of the job.
