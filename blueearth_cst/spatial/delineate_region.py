"""Delineate ``shared.basin.region`` once per project (ADR 0003).

Rule ``delineate_region``'s script — the SINGLE producer of
``spatial/geoms/region.geojson``, declared identically in all three workflows
(``1.01b`` / ``2.03b`` / ``3.01b``) from ``snake_utils.region_rule``.

Before ADR 0003 the same polygon was delineated TWICE from the same inputs:
once by rule 1.02 (``spatial/products.py::_region_geometry``, on its way to
``basins.geojson``) and once per climate-store key by the store producer
(``store_region.geojson``). Measured on a real project, the two agreed exactly
— agreement maintained by coincidence, since nothing compared them. Worse, WF2
declared the entire climate-store producer purely to obtain that polygon, so a
projections-only run paid for a multi-decade climate extraction to learn a
basin outline.

The extraction stays **model-free**, which is the property R07 B1 bought and
this must not spend: the region comes from ``shared.basin.region`` plus the
data catalog, never from a built model's ``staticmaps.nc`` or
``staticgeoms/region.geojson``.

# NO `from __future__ import annotations` here, deliberately: Snakemake's
# `script:` directive executes this module through a generated wrapper that
# PREPENDS its own preamble, and a future import is then no longer the first
# statement — "SyntaxError: from __future__ imports must occur at the beginning
# of the file", at rule run time rather than at import. Every other `script:`
# module in this repo omits it for the same reason.

    ``hydrography``/``basin_index`` are catalog ENTRY NAMES, not paths — hydromt
    resolves them against ``data_libs`` itself (verified on the pinned hydromt
    1.3.1). They default to the shipped build template's ``setup_basemaps``
    values; rule 1.02 raises if the two ever disagree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model_region : str | dict
        ``shared.basin.region``. A Python-dict-literal string (the form the
        project config carries, e.g. ``"{'subbasin': [9.666, 0.4476],
        'uparea': 100}"``) is parsed with ``ast.literal_eval``, matching
        ``prepare_build_config.merge_build_config``.
    data_libs : str | Path
        Data catalog(s) to resolve the hydrography sources against.
    hydrography, basin_index : str
        Catalog entry names for the flow-direction data and its basin index.
    region_out : str | Path, optional
        When given, the delineated GeoDataFrame is written there as GeoJSON
        (parents created) — the rule's ``region_geojson`` output.

    Returns
    -------
    geopandas.GeoDataFrame
        The delineated region; ``.total_bounds`` is the extraction bbox.
