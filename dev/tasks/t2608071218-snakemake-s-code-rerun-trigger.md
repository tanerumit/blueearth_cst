> [!note] Overview
> **What** — Make a code change to wf2's rule 2.04 actually re-trigger it.
> **Why** — Snakemake's `code` trigger does not reach it, so a fix to that rule can land and never re-run — the output stays stale and looks current.
> **Effort** — Unknown: the cause was found in 2026-07 and the mechanism is understood, but the fix shape is not settled.

  entry verbatim; it is the reproducible context, not a summary.

## Detail

**Snakemake's `code` rerun-trigger does NOT reach wf2's rule 2.04.**
Discovered 2026-07-25 while trying to propagate the `intersection()` fix.
Rule 2.04 `monthly_change` names `get_change_climate_proj.py` directly as its
`script:`, so an edit to it should have re-run the rule — it did not, even
under an explicit `--rerun-triggers code`. Cause is structural: 2.04's output
is `temp()` (already reclaimed) and rule 2.05's inputs are wrapped in
`ancient(...)`, which tells Snakemake to ignore their timestamps; once 2.05's
outputs exist the whole 2.04 layer leaves the DAG, so there is no job whose
code hash could be compared. Same family as the P3-3 finding that
`--forcerun generate_weather_realization` does not cascade the wf3 sweep.
**Practical rule: after fixing computational code in this repo, `--dry-run`
first to confirm the affected rules are actually in the DAG, and reach for an
explicit `--forcerun <rule>` rather than trusting the code trigger.** Worth
considering whether the `ancient()` wrappers on 2.05's inputs are still
earning their keep, or whether they are over-broad insurance that now hides
real staleness.
