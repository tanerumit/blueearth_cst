"""Run the vendored `todoboard` CLI that backs `dev/tasks/` and `dev/TODO.md`.

`dev/TODO.md` is GENERATED — edit the note under `dev/tasks/` and re-render,
never the table. This wrapper exists because the CLI ships inside the
`todo-board` skill bundle rather than in this repo: the skill directory is
per-user, gitignored and symlinked (see AGENTS.md, "The agent-config
directories"), so its path cannot be committed. Without the wrapper the
invocation is an undocumented `PYTHONPATH=<machine path> python -m todoboard`,
which is how a board note landed on 2026-08-12 with the table left one row
stale — the CLI was simply not reachable and nothing said so.

Usage (from anywhere in the repo, including a session slot):

    python dev/scripts/todoboard.py render
    python dev/scripts/todoboard.py list
    python dev/scripts/todoboard.py add "Title" --area wf3

Every verb and flag is the CLI's own. This wrapper resolves the package and
widens its Item and Area / Origin columns to 110 and 44 characters for this
project, including automatic renders after board mutations. Set
TODOBOARD_SKILL_DIR to override the search.
