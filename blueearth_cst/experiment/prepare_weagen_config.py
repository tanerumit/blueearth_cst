R5 extracts it into named functions (``build_weagen_config`` /

year math is reachable without a live ``snakemake`` global. Behavior-neutral:
the same dict is assembled and written.

    Seeds from the default weagen template, then overrides the output path,
    historical start year, number of years (``compute_nr_years``), file prefix
    and realization count from the snake config. Adds the two
    ``transient_change`` flags that ``impose_climate_change.R`` reads.

    **C29 removed the second, per-member config** this function used to build.
    Rule 3.05 emitted one ``weathergen_config_rlz_<n>_cst_<m>.yml`` per member —
    RLZ_NUM x ST_NUM files, each with its own log and benchmark — and the only
    thing that varied between them was the OUTPUT FILENAME, split into a prefix
    and a suffix because ``weathergenr::write_netcdf`` takes them separately.
    Snakemake already knows that path: it is rule 3.12's own declared output, so
    it is now passed as an argument and the rule is gone.

    **The snake config is no longer read from disk** (R13 D-10.6). This
    function took a path and re-opened it for exactly two things -- the
    realization count and the two ``transient_change`` flags -- both of
    which the Snakefile has already composed and validated. They now arrive
    as params, finishing a conversion the six params above had already taken
    three-quarters of the way, and the disk read disappears rather than
    being redirected at the split layout.

    The per-member file also copied in the whole ``stress_test.temp`` and
    ``stress_test.precip`` blocks — step counts and monthly min/max ranges — of
    which the R read only the two transient flags (finding F6). Anyone opening
    one to see what a run did read plausible perturbation ranges that had no part
    in it; the real values come from ``st_<m>.csv``. Only the two flags survive
    here, so the file no longer implies otherwise.
