"""End-to-end smoke test for the model-creation workflow (workflow 1).

Unlike ``test_cli.py`` (which only ``--dry-run``s the DAG), this actually runs
``snakemake all`` on the small test basin: it builds the Wflow model with
hydromt, adds forcing, and runs Wflow.jl to completion, then checks that the
discharge output was produced. This is the check that would have caught the
data-catalog and Julia failures that a dry-run cannot see.

It is opt-in and slow. It needs:
  * the local Deltares data mirror referenced by ``config/deltares_data.yml``
  * juliaup-managed Julia 1.11.7 with the project instantiated (``pixi run install``)

Run it with::

    pixi run pytest tests/test_workflow_build_model.py --run-integration

Skipped by default, and self-skips if the data mirror or Julia is absent.
