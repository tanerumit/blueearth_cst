    ``declare_path_tokens`` writes a process-wide env var, which is correct at

    the Snakefile. In the suite it is leakage: four tests build rules through
    ``snakemake.api``, which parses a real Snakefile IN-PROCESS and therefore
    declares that project's folders for every test that runs afterwards. Three
    header tests then failed in the full suite while passing in isolation
    (measured 2026-08-14), which is the failure mode that costs the most to
    diagnose.

    Autouse and unconditional: no test should be reading a declaration it did

    A test that asserts a figure's STRUCTURE — which panels exist, what they are
    called, which files were written — is answered identically at 100 dpi and at
    the 600 dpi export default, and 600 dpi costs seconds per sheet because the
    whole figure is rasterised at 4251 px wide. The resolution is a property of
    the shipped artifact, not of the assertion.

    Patched at EVERY binding site, because the export default is imported into
    four module namespaces rather than read through one: ``plot_evaluation``
    reads ``plot_style.RASTER_DPI`` at call time, while ``plot_map``,
    ``plot_spatial_maps`` and ``climate_figures`` bound their own copies at
    import. Patching one of them leaves the others at 600 and the test looks
    like it got faster without having got faster. ``hasattr`` guards the loop so
    a module that stops importing the name does not turn this into an error.

    Opt in per module with ``pytestmark = pytest.mark.usefixtures(...)``, not
    autouse: a test that DOES care about the export resolution should get the
    real one, and an autouse fixture would take it away invisibly.

    Opt in only where it MEASURES faster. ``test_plot_climate_source`` was
    marked and then unmarked: its slow test costs 10 s in climate preparation,
    not in rasterisation, and the marker bought nothing. ``climate_figures``
    stays in the list below regardless — the list is what makes the patch
    correct wherever it is used, not a record of who uses it.

    config idiom did not need rewriting when the config layout split:

    ``project`` / ``shared`` / ``workflows`` is hoisted into its owning
    workflow's file, so a test can keep writing ``reporting:`` at the top level
    of the mapping it mutates.
