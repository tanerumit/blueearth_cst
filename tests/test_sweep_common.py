"""`dev/scripts/sweep_common.py` — the contract three sweeps share.

`sweep_stale_spellings`, `sweep_identity_renames` and `sweep_unread_config_keys`
all import `Allowance`, `classify`, `Floor` and `check_floors` from here, and
`dev/scripts/` libraries are contract surfaces with test consumers: an import
error or a behaviour change here fails CI on a bare checkout, on both legs.

Each sweep's own tests exercise ONE path through this file. The boundaries —
where a floor starts failing, what happens to a path outside the repository —
are only ever hit incidentally there, which is how a shared primitive drifts.
