"""Tool caches live under `.tmp/`, and the repo root stays free of them.

The pytest and ruff caches were redirected out of the root on 2026-08-11
(`pyproject.toml` `cache_dir` / `cache-dir`) so that the root holds project
files rather than tool state. Nothing checked either half of that afterwards,
and both halves can fail quietly:

* **The setting can be dropped or misspelled.** Neither tool errors on a
  removed `cache_dir` -- each silently falls back to its own default at the
  root, which looks exactly like the state before the redirect.
* **A stale directory survives the redirect.** This is what actually happened:
  the root `.ruff_cache` and `.pytest_cache` were never deleted when the
  setting landed, so they sat there with content frozen at 2026-08-10 while
  every real run wrote to `.tmp/`. Seven days later they read as "the redirect
  is not working" -- a directory that is merely *stale* is indistinguishable,
  by eye, from one that is live.

The second case is why this checks the ROOT and not only the setting. A
config assertion alone would have been green throughout.

**The one invocation that still writes a root cache is `ruff check
--isolated`**, which discards config by definition -- and pyproject.toml and
the CI workflow both invite it as a diagnostic for the pinned rule set. Set
`RUFF_CACHE_DIR=.tmp/ruff_cache` when running it; that environment variable
takes precedence over `--isolated`'s config-less default (verified 2026-08-18),
so the honest fix is available at the call site rather than as an exception
here. `.gitignore` and ruff's self-written `.ruff_cache/.gitignore` keep such a
directory out of a commit either way -- this is about the root being READABLE,
which ignoring does not help with.

    Matched by SHAPE rather than by a list of the two names known today, so a
    tool nobody has added yet -- mypy, coverage's `.cache`, a future linter --
    is caught the first time it drops a directory here, instead of being
    noticed by eye weeks later. `.tmp/` itself is the destination and is not a
    match; nothing else in this repo's root is.

    `__pycache__` is matched too, by literal name: the shape rule above misses
    it on the leading dot alone, and it is a cache by any reading of the repo's
    "the root carries no cache directory of any kind" constraint. It got in
    once -- a root `__pycache__` holding a single orphan `.pyc` from a
    `_patch_helper.py` that no longer exists, found 2026-09-17. Nothing at the
    root is importable today, so it can only come back from a throwaway script
    run from here; the fix is to put that script under `.tmp/`, not to relax
    this. The check stays ROOT-ONLY on purpose -- `tests/__pycache__` and
    `blueearth_cst/**/__pycache__` are normal and would make a recursive
    version fail on every developer machine.
