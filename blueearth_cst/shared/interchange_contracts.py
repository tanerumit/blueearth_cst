"""Interchange-contract validators for the two CST substitution seams.

This module pins — as machine-checkable, pure functions — the contract
surfaces at the two points where a CST component could be swapped for an
alternative implementation:

- the **weather-generator seam** (``weathergenr`` today): validators
  ``validate_wg1``..``validate_wg6`` + the relational
  ``validate_wg5_catalog_runs``;
- the **hydrological-model seam** (Wflow-SBM built by hydromt today):
  validators ``validate_hm1``..``validate_hm7`` (no ``validate_hm6a`` — its
  contract surface is pinned transitively by HM-4) + the relational
  ``validate_hm_gauge_column_identity``.

Source of record: ``dev/milestones/p32b/interchange-contracts-design.md`` (ACCEPTED
2026-07-24, §5.5) and the two seam docs ``dev/reference/contracts/*-seam.md``.

Design invariants this module obeys (do not relax without a design change):

1. **Pure functions over PARSED objects.** Every validator takes an already
   parsed object — ``xarray.Dataset`` / ``pandas.DataFrame`` /
   ``dict``-from-yaml / ``dict``-from-``tomllib`` / ``geopandas.GeoDataFrame``
   — never a path. The caller owns all file I/O. This is what lets the same
   function serve a synthetic in-memory unit test, a real-fixture integration
   test, and a future in-pipeline guard with no move (design C5).
2. **``-> list[str]`` divergence report; empty list ⇒ pass.** Mirrors the
   house drift-guard ``compare_project_consistency``
   (``blueearth_cst/experiment/check_project_consistency.py``), not the
   ``ValueError``-raising ``validate_experiment_name``. Every violation is
   surfaced at once (better for a swapper diagnosing a candidate artifact).
3. **No ``assert`` / ``AssertionError`` in validator bodies.** ``assert`` is
   stripped under ``python -O`` / ``PYTHONOPTIMIZE``, so a future optimized
   in-pipeline guard lifting these functions would silently no-op — it would
   fail *open* on exactly the path this module is built for (design §6.5).
   A returned report never vanishes.
4. **Asserted-if-present semantics** where the design records a property but
   does not pin it as a hard contract surface — chiefly the HM-2 forcing
   units (wflow is name-keyed via the TOML ``[input.forcing]`` block, so no
   consumer reads the unit attr): the validator appends a message only when
   the attr is *present and wrong*; an absent attr never blocks (design §5.5).
5. **CST automation scope (C3).** Validators pin OUR consumed/rewritten
   subset of the upstream hydromt / wflow / weathergenr formats; they never
   assert an upstream-owned internal (the full staticmaps schema, wflow
   physics blocks, the outlets-map id derivation). See the per-validator
   docstrings for the pinned-vs-unpinned boundary.

Stdlib + xarray + pandas + geopandas + pyyaml + tomllib only — no new
dependency. This module is imported by ``tests/test_interchange_contracts.py``
and by **no** Snakefile rule: it is DAG-invisible and changes no pipeline
behavior (design C2).

    table. The mechanism changes with it, not only the constants: a 12-row
    assertion becomes ``12 x ST_NUM`` plus a ``(st_id, month)`` completeness
    check, and ``st_0`` must be ABSENT.

    ``st_num`` reaches this validator as an argument, the way the relational

    inferred from the table itself and only its internal consistency is checked

    could not tell a complete table from a truncated one.

    Three things are checked that the old per-member shape could not express:

    - **``st_0`` is absent.** Its absence is load-bearing rather than tidy: it is
      what makes "not on the surface" structural, so a consumer joining results
      to the lookup cannot place the baseline on the surface by accident.
    - **The ``st_id`` width is UNIFORM.** The whole join-key inference rests on
      one width per table, so this is where that becomes a checked property
      rather than a documented one.
    - **``st_id`` is TEXT.** Read with inferred dtypes, ``01`` comes back as
      ``1``; a validator subject to the very hazard the contract names could not
      detect it.

#: WG-3 config surface — the key set the R side reads (design §5.2, read-only

#: Renamed 2026-08-12 from the single ``generateWeatherSeries`` section: that

#:
#: **weathergenr 2.0.0 (2026-08-17).** One key changed here: ``relax_priority``
#: became ``relax_order`` and is now pinned, because the wrapper forwards it (see
#: the entry below). Every other section and key survives the major version
#: unchanged — the argument sets of ``run_weather_generator``,
#: ``generate_weather``, ``apply_climate_perturbations`` and ``write_netcdf``
#: were checked one by one against the 2.0.0 sources.
#:
#: 2.0.0 also weakened the FAILURE MODE this list guards, without weakening the
#: reason for it. ``run_weather_generator`` forwarded every ``config`` entry
#: unconditionally, so an absent one arrived as an explicit ``NULL`` that
#: replaced the receiving function's default; it now OMITS absent entries, so a

#: because the point is that every setting this toolbox runs on is a stated
#: choice, readable in one file — not that upstream would otherwise crash.
#:
#: Every key is pinned for the same reason the transient flags are: the R reads
#: it, and an omission silently substitutes whatever upstream defaults to. That
#: is the C34 defect, and a contract is how it stays fixed.

    The gauge-column set is a **single degree of freedom** flowing TOML

    validator cannot see a break *between* artifacts: the predecessor reduction
    (removed 2026-09-25) derived the gauge set from the FIRST csv via a
    hard-coded ``Q_`` prefix filter and indexed every other csv with it, so a
    renamed gauge header silently emptied ``Q_vars`` (a gauge-less q_indicators)
    and a later mismatch KeyErrored deep in the reduction.
