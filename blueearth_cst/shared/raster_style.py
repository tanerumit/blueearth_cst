"""``RasterStyle`` — how one quantity is drawn, with nothing needed to draw it.

Split out of :mod:`blueearth_cst.shared.cartographic_map` so a module that only
DECLARES styles need not import the module that RENDERS them. ``cartographic_map``
imports cartopy at module scope; ``plot_spatial_maps`` builds five module-level
``RasterStyle`` constants and is imported by ``build_model.smk`` at PARSE time
for :func:`~blueearth_cst.shared.plot_spatial_maps.figure_paths` alone, so every
WF1 dry-run paid for cartopy to obtain a plain data object (t2608210029).

Nothing here draws, classifies or resolves anything — it is a declaration and
its ``replace``. The classifier, the colormap builders and the diverging
resolvers stay in ``cartographic_map``, which is where the rendering lives and
where a style is interpreted. ``cartographic_map`` re-exports ``RasterStyle``,
so no public name moved and every existing import still resolves.

Keep this module free of third-party imports. That property is the whole point
of the split, and it is not enforced by anything but this sentence.
