# dev/milestones/

One folder per milestone, holding its design, plan, review, migration,
and evidence documents. Narrative and rationale live in
[`../roadmap.md`](../roadmap.md); this is the file index.

Most folders here are sealed milestones. A folder is also created when a
milestone is **registered** — its design accepted but not yet implemented — so
the accepted design has a source-of-record home instead of sitting in
`../working/`. The `Sealed` column says which is which.

These folders moved here from the `dev/` root on 2026-08-02. That was a path
change only — no file was renamed, split, or edited beyond its path prefix, and
the folders' internal grammar is deliberately **not** normalised. A sealed
milestone's record stays as it was written.

| `r13/` | R13 — Config tiers | — *(registered)* | `r13-config-tiers` |

Phase grouping: `phase-1/` is Phase 1 (Foundation); `r01`–`r06` are Phase 2
(Refactor, complete 2026-07-23); `p31`–`p33` are Phase 3 (Usability &
flexibility, complete 2026-07-25); `r07` is Phase 4 (Layout consolidation);
`r08` is Phase 5 (Workflow rework); `r09` is Phase 6 (Project tree redesign);
`r10` is Phase 7 (Naming coherence); `r11`–`r12` are Phase 8 (WF3 rework, open —
R11 sealed, R12 registered); `r13` is Phase 9 (Configuration modularization,
design accepted 2026-08-21, not yet implemented).

**Phase 3's folders are named `p3x`, not `rNN`, and that is not an anomaly.**
Phase 3 milestones carry `P3-x` identifiers in `roadmap.md` (§ P3-1, P3-2a,
P3-2b, P3-3) and their tags follow suit. There is no `p32/` — P3-2 split into
`p32a/` and `p32b/`, which is why a reader looking for `p32` finds nothing.

`p33` carries a tag but no `sealed` line in `roadmap.md` — it is recorded there
as *scoped 2026-07-24*, so the date column is left blank rather than guessed.

## Conventions

- A milestone folder is the default home for that milestone's **promoted
  working notes** — see the promotion rule in [`../README.md`](../README.md).
  `r08/` is the fullest example: eighteen falsifier and validation notes, cited
  from shipped modules and tests.
- Filenames vary by era and are grandfathered. Later milestones converge on
  `<topic>-design.md`, `<topic>-task-brief.md`, `<topic>-intake.md`,
  `<topic>-design-review-record.md`, `migration_<topic>.md`, and
  `baseline_diffs.md`.
- New milestones get a folder here, not at the `dev/` root.
