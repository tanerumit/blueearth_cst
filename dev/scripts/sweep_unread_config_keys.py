"""`C-37` — find a declared config key that no reader reads.

The third sweep, and the one R14 left behind: `D-11.4` put everything except
`C-37` and `C-83` in one bundle, and no phase brief picked it up afterwards.
It is also the only remaining answer to design question `P2` — R14 found its
misplaced keys by hand and zero by machine, and a config shape that does not
make this check feasible has not solved the problem with consequences.

**What it asks.** A user copies the five templates in `config/templates/` and
fills them in. Every key there — live, or commented at its default, which the
template header says is how an optional setting is shown — is a promise that
setting it does something. A key no code reads is a promise the toolbox does not
keep, and it is invisible: the run succeeds and the setting changes nothing.

**Why it is not `sweep_stale_spellings`.** That sweep asks whether a spelling is
DEAD, from the loader's retired-key table. This asks whether a LIVE key has a
consumer, and its two sides are built from different places entirely.

**Fail-closed** (`D-14.5`, and the reason this note exists at all). R14's own
register re-measure demonstrated the failure mode live: its ground-truth
extraction silently returned zero keys, and the pass then reported MORE problems
while knowing LESS, with nothing in its output saying so. A check like this one
fails open the same way and just as quietly — an empty reader side reports every
key unread, an empty declared side reports a clean bill. So BOTH sides carry a
floor, checked before anything is reported, and a floor breach replaces the
result rather than annotating it.

#: The declared side: the templates a user copies. `config/defaults/` is NOT
#: here — those are build configs a rule reads wholesale and hands to hydromt,
#: whose vocabulary is hydromt's rather than ours (AGENTS.md, Hard Constraints).
#: Nor is `config/templates/archive/`, which the glob's `project_config*` prefix
#: excludes anyway: its README withholds support and says a stale key there
#: fails at parse time rather than being ignored.
#:
#: **The shipped seeds under `test_case/` are a KNOWN GAP, measured rather than
#: assumed.** On 2026-09-07 they carried 58 leaf names against the templates'
#: 53, and 11 the templates do not declare. Two of those are real config keys
#: (`build_config`, `waterbodies_config`, both read) — a template documentation
#: gap, which is this check's MIRROR question and not this one. Most of the rest
#: are `VariableSpec` fields (`source`, `canonical`, `units`, `change`), read by
#: dataclass construction rather than by subscript, so extending the declared
#: side to the seeds needs a reader form for that first or it would report four
#: keys that are read perfectly well. Filed rather than half-done; the boundary
#: is pinned by a test so a green run is not mistaken for full coverage.

#: Matching every subscript in the tree put 651 names on the reader side and

#: the intermediate keys unread, which is a false alarm on the deepest and most
#: error-prone part of the config.
#:
#: A segment subscripted by a VARIABLE is stepped over rather than ending the
