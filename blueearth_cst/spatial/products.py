"""Compose and write the versioned spatial-foundation products.

Two halves since ADR 0003 §8, split at the thematic-raster seam:

* the **vector half** (``prepare_spatial_units`` / ``write_spatial_units``) —
  region polygon + hydrography catalog + ``shared.basin.gauge_points`` into the
  five vector layers, the location registry, and the hydrography grid stack.
  Model-free, engine-neutral, and declared by ALL THREE workflows so WF2 and
  WF3 can obtain basin and subbasin boundaries without resampling a single
  thematic raster;
* the **raster half** (``prepare_spatial_maps`` / ``write_spatial_maps``) —
  reads that seam back, adds the LULC/LAI/soil layers, and writes
  ``spatial_maps.nc`` with its catalog and report. **WF1 only**: it exists to
  parameterise Wflow.

The seam is NOT free, and the split is not a pure decomposition (ADR 0003 §8a):
what crossed it in memory is the whole hydrography grid stack, so the vector
half writes it as an intermediate the raster half declares as an input.
Recomputing it instead would make WF1 read the hydrography twice with two grids
that can drift.
