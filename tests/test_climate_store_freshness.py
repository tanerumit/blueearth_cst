"""R07 B1 / ext2-01: the data catalog is the store's freshness boundary.

The producer declares exactly one input in both DAGs — the ``project.data_sources``
catalog, plain (never ``ancient()``). Two properties follow, and this module
pins both against a real Snakemake invocation:

1. **Freshness.** Editing the catalog in place schedules ``extract_historical_climate``
   **exactly once**. Pre-R07 the catalog rode only as a ``params`` path string,
   so an in-place edit re-triggered nothing — a staleness gap that predates R07.
2. **No oscillation.** Once the store is fresh again, ``--dry-run`` schedules
   nothing in **either** workflow. The ext1-02 oscillation needed *asymmetric*
   input sets; the symmetric singleton cannot reproduce it, and this is the
   empirical check on that claim.

Mechanics: the store outputs are fabricated and provenance is seeded with
``snakemake --touch`` (which records mtimes, not the full code/params metadata),
then every check is edit-then-``--dry-run``. Executing the rule for real is not
an option in a unit suite — it would fetch era5. The property under test is the
input **edge**, which the mtime trigger exercises directly.

Data behind an unchanged catalog entry is deliberately OUT of scope (see
``dev/milestones/r07/migration_project-layout.md`` §2f); the escape hatch is
``snakemake --forcerun extract_historical_climate``.
