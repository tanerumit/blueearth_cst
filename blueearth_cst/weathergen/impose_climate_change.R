# second in 32.9%. The round trip is NOT exact in general and cannot be made so
# -- 1,155 of 50,000 levels admit no float64 percent that inverts them exactly

# producer refuses to go below (D35), and bit-identical on every level of every

# PARAMETERS CHANGING PER RUN ##################################################

# Apply climate changes to baseline weather data stored in the nc file.
# `diagnostic = FALSE` makes the return shape compatible with write_netcdf
# directly (a list of data.frames, one per grid cell — same as the old
# imposeClimateChanges return).
# WHICH member, and BY WHAT. The rule banner already carries `[rlz N | st M]`
# and the `[n/total]` job counter, but under `-c 3` several 3.12 jobs interleave
# their body rows on one console, and a bare "Applying climate perturbations"
# cannot be attributed to the banner above it -- so it reads as the same row
# repeated once per member, which on a full grid is exactly what it looks like.
#
# `output_stem` rather than a re-derived id: it is the declared output name,
# this script's one source of truth for the member (see the derivation above).
#
# Summarized across the twelve monthly rows. Every shipped grid holds one value
# for all twelve, so the summary is normally a single number -- but the lookup
# schema permits monthly variation, and printing `[1]` of a varying vector would
# be a confidently wrong row, so a varying factor prints its range instead.
