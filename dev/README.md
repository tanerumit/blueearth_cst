# dev/

Development process and project record. Everything here supports building the
project; none of it ships. The lifecycle that fills these folders is the
`project-system` skill's workflow.

## Layout

Organised by **how long a thing stays true**, because that decides both where
it goes and when it may be deleted.

**Happening now** — small, churns constantly:

| Path | Holds |
|---|---|
| `tasks/` | **The board.** One note per open item — `todo-item` (work) or `watch-item` (true, tracked, no action intended). The source of truth |
| ↳ `origin:` | Which milestone the item fell out of, using `reference/roadmap.md`'s own IDs (`R10`, `P3-3`, `M02b`). Set it only from a **recorded** origin — the source item's ID, or the `followups.md` section it was migrated from. Leave it blank when the lineage would have to be inferred from prose, and say so in the note's `## Refs`: the Origin column is read when prioritising, so a guess there costs more than a gap |
| `TODO.md` | **Generated** view of `tasks/` — `todoboard render` writes it and the banner says do-not-edit. Never hand-edit it; edit the note |
| `LOG.md` | Closure ledger. One row per item the board has closed since 2026-08-07, **capped at three short sentences** — see the cap below |
| `working/` | Legacy working notes awaiting classification and migration; do not add files or folders |

Do not create `dev/drafts/` or add to `dev/working/`. Put substantial task
material in the owning live task's `tasks/<id>/` sidecar and link it from the
board note. At closure, promote material that a future reader needs into
`reference/` or `records/` and remove the task sidecar; otherwise let Git
history retain it. Existing `working/` paths remain until their citations and
owners can move together.

The `main` worktree is the canonical board. `dev/scripts/todoboard.py` targets
it even when invoked from a session worktree. Edit notes there, render the view,
and commit board changes on `main` separately from feature work. A task's
`branch:` field links unfinished implementation without copying its note into
the task branch. The repository wrapper refuses to use a different board root.
On Windows, open `dev/00-current-board-main/TODO.md` in a session worktree to
see the live main board in File Explorer. The local setup script links that
directory to main's `dev/`. Run `pwsh -File dev/scripts/setup-board-view.ps1
-ExcludeSnapshots` once per clean session worktree to leave its tracked
`TODO.md` and `tasks/` out of the working tree through per-worktree sparse
checkout. The main worktree keeps the complete board, and the session index
still records it for Git history and merges. With `core.hooksPath` set to
`.githooks`, checkout and merge hooks restore the link. The link is ignored by
Git and never committed.

**Stays true** — consulted while working, rewritten rarely and deliberately:

| Path | Holds |
|---|---|
| `reference/` | The rules and the phase narrative (`roadmap.md`): `naming.md`, `agent-activation.md`, `git-conventions.md`, `contracts/`, `workflows/` — see its `README.md` |

**Happened** — records of what was done, kept by identity:

| Path | Holds |
|---|---|
| `records/decisions/` | ADRs — **permanent**. Superseded ones stay with a pointer; evidence in a `<adr-slug>/` sibling folder |
| `records/milestones/` | Every milestone's design / plan / review / evidence docs — see its own `README.md` for the index |
| `tasks/2026-07-21_pre-r6-followups.md` | The one **pre-board** record: `tasks/` held closed-task records until 2026-08-07, when it became the open board. Bannered, kept, and ignored by the board's loader (it carries no `type:`) |

**Decays** — snapshots of a system that keeps moving:

| Path | Holds |
|---|---|
| `records/reviews/` | Process reviews and post-milestone self-check registers. **Prunable** — see the retention rule below |

**Pinned by code** — these paths are constructed in Python, so moving them is a
code change, not a documentation change:

| Path | Holds |
|---|---|
| `scripts/` | Developer scripts — inspect or maintain the repo, never part of a run (`scripts/README.md`). `check_baseline.py` derives the repo root from its own depth |
| `baseline/` | Replication baseline fingerprints and the discharge reference series; `MANIFEST_PATH_DEFAULT` hardcodes `dev/baseline/manifest.json` |

**Scratch lives outside `dev/`.** Disposable machine-local output goes in the
repo-root `.tmp/` — one ignored directory for everything: probe output,
`scaffold_project_tree.py`'s default target (`.tmp/scaffold`), and any
`pytest --basetemp`. `dev/tmp/` was merged into it on 2026-08-02; there is no
second scratch location, and nothing in `dev/` is a place to park disposables.
The pytest and ruff caches were redirected into it on 2026-08-11
(`.tmp/pytest_cache`, `.tmp/ruff_cache`), set in `pyproject.toml`.

Shard `tasks/` or `records/reviews/` into `<year>/` subfolders only if a flat folder
ever grows unwieldy. Generated results, figures, and model outputs go in the
project-root `output/` (gitignored), not `dev/`. Create optional folders only
when first needed — and put new ones in the table above when you do.

## Exceptions

`project-system`'s layout defines the `dev/` grammar; these entries sit outside
it on purpose. Run `brain status --layout --project .` from the brain
infrastructure checkout to check conformance.

| Path | Owner | Retention | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dev/baseline/` | Replication validation | Frozen per baseline; replaced only by a recorded successor baseline | `dev/scripts/check_baseline.py` (`MANIFEST_PATH_DEFAULT`), `build_model.smk`, `analyze_projections.smk`, `config/advanced_settings.yml` |
| `dev/00-current-board-main/` | `dev/scripts/setup-board-view.ps1` | Ignored link to main's `dev/`, session worktrees only | `dev/scripts/setup-board-view.ps1`, `.githooks` checkout and merge hooks, `.gitignore` |
| `dev/working/` | Repository owner | Frozen legacy; no new files; migrate folder by folder as citations move | `dev/reference/sealed-records.yml`, `.gitattributes` |

## The promotion rule

**A cited note is a record, not a draft.** Before deleting anything from
`working/` at closure, grep the repo for its filename. If a test, module,
config, or tracked document cites it, it is source-of-record: promote it to the
milestone folder (or `tasks/` / `records/reviews/` / `records/decisions/`) and update every
citation in the same commit. Citations live in docstrings and prose, so
deleting one breaks provenance silently and no test fails.

This is not hypothetical. On 2026-08-02, 27 files were promoted out of
`working/` — eighteen to `records/milestones/r08/` alone — and eight of them were cited
by shipped modules, `analyze_projections.smk`, and `pixi.toml`.

Never let `working/` or `tmp/` hold the only copy of a primary source: `tmp/`
is gitignored and one `git clean -fdX` from gone.

## The retention rule

Only `records/reviews/` is prunable. A process review or a post-milestone self-check is
a snapshot of a system that keeps moving, so the folder would otherwise
accumulate thousands of lines describing a repository that no longer exists.

A review may be deleted when **all three** hold:

1. **Nothing cites it** — including other reviews. Check with
   `git grep -l <filename>`, not intuition.
2. **Its items are dispositioned**, and anything carried forward has landed as
   a board note in `tasks/` or as a decision.
3. **Its durable output has left** — if the review produced skill or role
   candidates, those changes are committed in `brain`. The lesson's home is the
   skill; the review that prompted it is then spent.

Delete whole files. **Do not collapse a register to its outcome summary** — that
rule was tried on 2026-08-02 and fails in practice, twice over: the post-R6
assessment is cited by 23 individual `O-` numbers from R7 docs, `roadmap.md`,
and `pyproject.toml`, and the post-R8 register's own summary states it is "a
derived overview, not a substitute". Citers reference the detail, not just the
path.

**Partial supersession means annotate, not delete.** A later revision often
supersedes only some sections — `wf2-v2-process-review-r2.md` replaces sections
1, 3 and 5 of its predecessor while 2, 4 and 6 stand. Put a banner in the
superseded file saying exactly which sections went and where; keep both.

### The one place a register WAS compressed — and what made it safe

`followups.md` was the exception. It no longer exists — the todo-board replaced
it on 2026-08-07 — but the rule it established governs the next register anyone
is tempted to compress, so it is kept rather than deleted with the file. (The
adoption's own working notes were drained on 2026-08-09 under the promotion rule
above: the board exists and the `watch-item` type shipped in the `todo-board`
skill, so the brief was spent. Recoverable from that commit if ever needed.)

On 2026-08-07 that file had reached 2,038 lines, roughly half of it items
already closed, because a closure note had grown into a post-mortem averaging
29 lines. The closed items were compressed into a brief archive; the open ones
became board notes later the same day. The archive was retired once its lessons
had durable homes. Recover a cited pre-board item by ID with
`git show 45e3a564:dev/followups-archive.md`.

That was allowed only because condition 3 above — **its durable output has
left** — was checked item by item and already held. Every reusable lesson in
those write-ups had been promoted at the time it was learned: the `ancient()`
trap to `dev/reference/workflows/rule-index.md`, the `tee_to_log` stream
boundary to `snake_utils._Tee`, the `LOG_RULES` literal constraint to
`tests/test_log_rules_contract.py`, the branch-shared-fixture hazard to
`check_baseline.py`. The long entries were duplicating guidance that already
lived somewhere it is actually read. Exactly one lesson was still unpromoted
(R9-4's) and it went into `AGENTS.md` as part of the sweep.

So the rule generalizes rather than contradicting the one above: **compress a
closure note only after its lesson has a home outside the backlog, and name the
commit the full text is recoverable from.** What is not allowed is compressing
first and hoping the detail was not load-bearing — which is the `records/reviews/`
failure this file already records. The other half of the safeguard: the item IDs
are cited from code, tests and Snakefiles, so the archive keeps every ID rather
than merging items away.

Nothing outside `records/reviews/` is prunable. `records/decisions/` is permanent by
construction, `records/milestones/` and `tasks/` are identity-indexed records, and
`reference/` describes the current system.

### The cap on `LOG.md` rows — the same rule, applied before the fact

`LOG.md` is the next register anyone will be tempted to compress, so the rule
above is written into it up front rather than applied in a panic at 2,000 lines.

**A closure row is at most three short sentences in plain language: what closed,
why, and where anything durable now lives.** When a closure produced a finding
worth keeping — a measurement, an owner ruling, a defect class, a tolerance — it
goes to its own home *first* (a `reference/` doc, a test, an ADR, a board note),
and the row points there. The row is the index; it is not the storage.

This is the promotion rule pointed forwards. Compressing after the fact needs
condition 3 checked item by item; capping up front means the lesson is placed
while the author still knows what it was.

**The cap constrains the ROW, not the work.** A closure whose content *is* the
finding — `t2608152230` carries the `rtol` `1e-9` → `1e-6` ruling, a 0.0-ulp
reconstruction, and four false greens found by running a validation plan rather
than reading it — does not get three sentences by deleting two of those. It gets
three sentences because they already live somewhere a future reader will
actually hit. If there is nowhere to put a finding, that is the signal to make a
home for it, not to lengthen the row.

**Retrofitting is per-row and evidence-first.** Before shortening any existing
row, grep the detail you intend to drop and confirm it survives elsewhere;
`git grep` is the check, not memory. Worked example — `t2608132100`'s dropped
measurements (6.43 MB across 82 blob versions, the 7.1 MB push) survive in
`reviews/2026-08-13_fao-branch-assessment.md`, `scripts/notebook_outputs.py`,
`docs/notebooks/README.md` and `tests/test_notebook_outputs.py`, one of them a
test, so that row is safe to cut from 172 words to 62. A row whose detail
survives nowhere is not a row to compress; it is a lesson without a home.

Rows written before 2026-08-19 are grandfathered and shortened opportunistically
under the paragraph above — never in a sweep, which is the mode that loses things.

Why a cap at all: the register took 48 closures in its first twelve days at a
median of 172 words, which is `followups.md`'s trajectory (2,038 lines, closure
notes averaging 29 lines) with the same cause — a closure note growing into a
post-mortem because there was no other place to put one.

## Milestone records

`records/milestones/` holds one folder per milestone. **`milestones/README.md` is the
index** — folder, milestone, seal date and tag — and is the only place that list
is maintained.

Deliberately not repeated here. This paragraph used to enumerate the folders and
give a count, and both went stale: it still read `r01/..r08/` and "all sixteen"
after R9, R10 and R11 had sealed, so the file that points at the index disagreed
with the index. One list, one home.

Two naming facts a reader trips over, since they cannot be inferred from the
folder names: Phase 3's milestones are `p31/`, `p32a/`, `p32b/`, `p33/` because
`roadmap.md` identifies them as `P3-x` rather than `Rn`; and there is no `p32/`,
because P3-2 split in two.

Two rules govern them:

- **New milestones get a folder there, not at the `dev/` root.** The thirteen
  that were at the root moved into `records/milestones/` on 2026-08-02 — a path change
  only, no file renamed, split, or edited beyond the prefix.
- **A sealed milestone's contents are not refactored.** Filenames and internal
  grammar vary by era and stay as written; later milestones converge on
  `<topic>-design.md`, `<topic>-task-brief.md`, `migration_<topic>.md`, and
  friends. A milestone folder is also the default home for that milestone's
  promoted working notes.

## Working rules

- **Admit before you track.** Small work fully explained by its diff and Git
  history creates no task ID or record. Track only work that must stay visible
  beyond the current session.
- **The board holds live work only.** Move closed tasks to `tasks/` and drain
  their working notes — deleting the uncited ones, promoting the rest.
- **Handoffs are self-contained.** A note handed to another session or runtime
  states objective, state, decisions, location, validation, next action, and
  blockers.
- **Record exact validation** — the commands run and their outcomes.
- **Log shipped features in the root changelog** (`CHANGELOG.md`) — feature-level
  entries only, linking `records/decisions/` or `tasks/` for the detail. It lives at the
  project root, not in `dev/`.
