# Atomic task lanes and worktrees

The worktree rules live in `AGENTS.md` § Worktrees; the lane conventions are owned by the `git-workflow` skill. This file is the long form behind both — slot mechanics, scope declaration, the lifecycle, and the worktree seeding rules with their measurements. Lifted from `AGENTS.md` @ 46f9df2 during the 2026-08-20 slim-down, unedited except for this header and the section heading that joins the two source blocks.

### Atomic task lanes — a reusable worktree, one fresh session per task

This repo keeps three persistent worktrees as allocator-managed task lanes. A lane is detached at `main` while `EMPTY`; `task-start` atomically claims one, checks out a short-lived branch, and launches a fresh agent process carrying the claim token. The `.pixi` environment and copied fixtures survive cleanup.

| Slot | Worktree | State |
|---|---|---|
| `session-1` | `.worktrees/blueearth_cst/session-1` | allocator managed; detached when `EMPTY` |
| `session-2` | `.worktrees/blueearth_cst/session-2` | allocator managed; detached when `EMPTY` |
| `session-3` | `.worktrees/blueearth_cst/session-3` | allocator managed; detached when `EMPTY` |

Three slots since 2026-08-19, up from two, because several sessions routinely work this repo at once — the same reason `worktree_policy: always` is set, and relaxing that has collided three times (`git log -- .git-workflow.yml`). The count is a **dial, not a design**: raise it when tasks queue behind occupied slots, at a one-time cost of one `worktree_seed` copy plus one `.pixi` build per slot added. The pool is **capacity, not taxonomy**: no slot means anything, and a task takes whichever is idle. Do not name a slot after a workflow or a kind of work.

**Why slots and not a worktree per task.** `worktree_policy: always` means every modifying task builds a worktree, so every task would otherwise pay a full `worktree_seed` copy *and* a `.pixi` solve — and this repo's `.pixi` is the expensive half. The slots amortize both into a one-time cost per slot that every later task reuses. That payoff is independent of concurrency: it arrives on purely sequential work too.

**Why slots and not the standing lanes they replaced.** From 2026-08-12 to 2026-08-17 this repo ran `lane/devmeta` and `lane/pipeline`, partitioned by territory. The partition itself was healthy — 45%/55% of traffic, neither a catch-all — but **37 of 162 commits touched both territories**, almost all "fix the code, then close the board note". That is 23% of tasks paying a second worktree visit, and the routing table needed a rule for spanning tasks because they were the ordinary case rather than the exception. A territory split that 23% of work refuses to respect has stopped predicting the work. Under one slot a spanning task is simply one branch touching both trees, with no visit and no split.

The trade is deliberate: lanes made merge order irrelevant **by construction**, because two territories cannot collide. A slot has no territory, so that guarantee is gone and the declaration below replaces it.

**Declare the expected write set before editing.** `task-start` begins in `CLAIMED`, which is read-only. Inspect first, then run `task-scope --path ...` for every path the task may write; this moves the lane to `OCCUPIED`. Include:

- implementation paths and workflow entry points (`*.smk`, `blueearth_cst/**`);
- shared seams — `blueearth_cst/shared/`, above all `snake_utils.py` (parses every Snakefile's config) and `interchange_contracts.py` (**is** the wf1→wf2/wf3 seam). 72–85% of each workflow's commits touch `shared/`, so two workflow-scoped tasks are **not** independent by default;
- `config/**`, `test_case/project_config_*.yml`, and the schema they validate;
- the exact test modules each task expects to edit; and
- mutable state outside the checkout — `project_dir`, `.snakemake` locks, the shared Julia depot under `~/.julia`.

The registry refuses overlapping path declarations. A `git diff` cannot replace scope: an untouched file may still be the next file two tasks intend to change.

Declare mutable state outside the checkout with `--resource`, including a shared `project_dir`, `.snakemake` lock, Julia depot, or board renderer. When paths or resources overlap, serialize the tasks. Land a shared contract as the smallest valid base change before allocating dependent work.

Because spanning tasks are the ordinary case here (37 of 162 commits), the common shape is one task in one slot touching both code and `dev/**` — that is fine and needs no declaration. The declaration is for the moment a slot is claimed while another one is still occupied.

**Ownership is the non-expiring filesystem claim, not the branch or process age.** `lane-banner-hook --current` prints slot, task, branch, state, and scope before every prompt. If it names a different task, or reports `UNCLAIMED TASK LANE`, stop; do not switch branches or continue the new task in that session. Use `task-status` from the primary checkout for the full registry. Recovery is an explicit `git-steward` action; never delete registry files manually.

**Lifecycle.** Allocate, scope, implement, freeze, then hand off:

```bash
S=.agents/skills/git-workflow/scripts/worktree-session.py
python $S task-start --task <task> --type <type> --base main -- codex
# In the fresh child session, before the first edit:
python $S task-scope --path <expected-path> [--resource <shared-resource>]
# ... edit, run the testing-policy check, and commit ...
python $S task-ready --validation "<checks and result>" [--risk <flag>]
# Stop. Under `integration_mode: self` an unflagged lane reports SELF_INTEGRATE and
# this session line integrates it from the primary; a risk flag still waits for the
# owner, and `approval`/`hybrid` route to git-integrator instead.
```

`task-start` compares each `worktree_seed` against the primary at allocation time: a copy the primary has moved past is refreshed, and a copy that *leads* the primary is left untouched and reported — the fixture-drift failure recorded in `t2608121258` (closed; see `dev/LOG.md`) is that second case, and it must never be overwritten. `integration-complete` proves the task branch is ancestral to `main` before parking the worktree and deleting the local branch.

**Adding a slot.** `slot-create --slot <name> --base main` adds the worktree detached, applies `worktree_seed` and `worktree_link`, then runs `worktree_provision` — `pixi install` plus `pixi run install`, several minutes and a whole `.pixi` prefix on disk. That cost is why the pool is small and standing rather than per-task, and `--no-provision` defers it (the slot then cannot run WF3 or the fixture layer until the env is built). `task-start` creates a missing slot implicitly, so `slot-create` is only how you pay that cost *before* you need the slot instead of while waiting for it. **Add the new slot to `session_slots` and the table above in the same commit. Adding capacity is an owner decision; normal tasks never select a slot directly.

**Routing a task.**

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Any normal modifying task | Run `task-start` from the primary checkout; the allocator chooses the slot and launches a fresh session. |
| Another lane is active | Declare full paths/resources; the registry permits disjoint work and refuses overlap. |
| All slots occupied | Report it and wait or postpone; do not reuse a running session or create a parallel branch there. |
| Primary checkout | Read-only inspection, board reservation, and integration only. |

`todoboard render` regenerates `dev/TODO.md`; declare `--resource todo-board-render` so no two lanes run it concurrently.

**Why the pipeline was never split further.** Kept from the lane analysis because it still governs how work is scoped: only 8 of 68 package-touching commits touch more than one workflow, but 72–85% of each workflow's commits also touch `blueearth_cst/shared/` — wf2 has *zero* commits that don't. `shared/` is 145 file-touches, larger than any single workflow territory, because `snake_utils.py` parses every Snakefile's config and `interchange_contracts.py` *is* the wf1→wf2/wf3 seam. Likewise 15 of the 35 plot-touching commits (43%) also touch non-plot code — `cartographic_map.py` is drawn through by rules 1.12 and 1.13, so a change there is never figure-local (see *Figures are terminal artifacts*). Standardizing every figure is a **sweep**: it edits call sites everywhere by definition. Both facts are why no territory partition held here.

## Worktrees — seeding, environments, and what a worktree cannot gate

**Run the workflows from the PRIMARY checkout, not from a task worktree.** Snakemake keeps its "what is up to date" metadata in `.snakemake/` under the *working directory*, so one `project_dir` driven from two checkouts gets two independent stores and they disagree — measured 2026-08-02, the same config and the same project planned 12 jobs from one checkout and 2 from the other. Snakemake also locks its working directory, so two checkouts running against one `project_dir` each hold their own lock while writing the same outputs: a corruption risk, not just confusion. Worktrees are for editing code and running `pytest`; pipeline runs belong in the one checkout `worktree_policy: always` already reserves for integration.

**Every worktree builds its OWN pixi env.** This said the opposite until R9 — that a worktree "resolves to the primary's copy instead of building its own" — and that is not what happens: each worktree carries its own tracked `pixi.toml`, so pixi creates a separate `.pixi/` beside it.

The practical consequence, measured in R9 P2: `pixi install` alone is not enough to run WF3 in a fresh worktree. `weathergenr` comes from `pixi run install` (remotes), so a worktree that has only had `pixi install` fails at rule 3.06 with `there is no package called 'weathergenr'`. **Run `pixi run install` in a worktree before running WF3 there** — and prefer running the pipeline from the primary checkout anyway, for the `.snakemake` reason above.

**A worktree carries no `test_case/`, and that silently downgrades the test suite.** `test_case/` is untracked, so `git worktree add` does not bring it. The fixture-dependent layer then **skips instead of failing** — measured 2026-08-07: `pytest tests/` in a fresh worktree reported *1567 passed, 31 skipped* and looked like a clean gate, while **15 of those skips were the fixture layer** this file already names as the one no worktree can exercise. A branch whose change crosses the project tree (an R9-style move, a `MODEL_DIRNAME` edit) is exactly the case that layer exists to catch, and exactly the case a worktree cannot report.

**Seed a new worktree with the fixture subtrees it needs, by COPY:**

```bash
# 46 MB — the tree named by 18 of the 25 fixture references in tests/
cp -r <primary>/test_case/test_local        <worktree>/test_case/
# 248 KB — only dev/scripts/preview_basin_map.py reads it
cp -r <primary>/test_case/basin_map_fixture <worktree>/test_case/
```

Copy those two subtrees, not all of `test_case/` — the whole directory is 361 MB and most of it is superseded reference trees (`ref_wf2_pre_*`, `test_local_pre_*`, `_pruned_*`). `test_case/test` and `test_case/gabon` appear in test source but do not exist on disk; their tests skip on the primary too, so they need nothing.

**Never symlink or junction it.** `tests/test_model_rebuild_cascade.py` runs a real `snakemake all -c 1` against the fixture, so a link would drive one `project_dir` from two checkouts — the same `.snakemake` divergence and concurrent-lock corruption this section already warns about, arriving through the test suite instead of through a deliberate run. A copy is an independent `project_dir`; a link is a shared one.

**The agent-config directories are the opposite case, and are SYMLINKED.** `.claude/`, `.codex/` and `.agents/` are gitignored per-user state, so no worktree gets them either — but they are read, not written, and one shared definition is the whole point. A copy at any level would dereference into a private fork that then answers with last week's version.

**The links are PER SKILL, not per directory**, and this file said otherwise until 2026-08-19. What a worktree gets is the three top-level directories as links to the primary's (`worktree_link:`). Inside them, `skills/` is an ordinary directory whose ENTRIES are one symlink each into `~/workspace/brain/artifacts/skills/<name>` — 14 of the brain's 60, a curated selection rather than the whole shelf. So a skill is present or absent one entry at a time, a missing one is a missing ENTRY rather than a broken directory link, and a skill can be reachable without being linked here at all: `todo-board` is absent from both `skills/` dirs and still works, because `dev/scripts/todoboard.py` searches those two, then the brain path, then `~/.claude/skills`.

Their absence does not fail, it **downgrades**: measured 2026-08-11, a worktree session resolved only 4 of the 18 project skills — every generic process skill still came from `~/.claude/skills`, so the 14 domain ones (`hydromt`, `snakemake`, `wflow`, `cst-run-control`, `climate-stress-testing`, …) were missing with nothing reporting it. Codex is worse: `.codex/agents/*.toml` are regular files with no brain fallback, so a Codex session there has no personas at all.

Both lists are declared in `.git-workflow.yml` (`worktree_seed:` copies, `worktree_link:` links) and applied by the launcher at `git worktree add` time. For a worktree created before that, reapply both from the primary's config:

```bash
python ~/workspace/brain/artifacts/skills/git-workflow/scripts/worktree-session.py sync
```

**Do NOT borrow the primary checkout to run a branch's gate.** The obvious alternative to seeding — `git checkout --detach <branch>` in the primary, run, `git checkout main` — parses as safe and is not, because a long test run holds the checkout for fifteen minutes and nothing reserves it.

Tried 2026-08-07 and it failed exactly that way. Another session merged its own branch **onto the detached HEAD**, noticed, checked out `main`, and redid the merge properly — all while the suite was running. `config/basemap/` exists only on the branch, so it vanished from the tree mid-run and six basemap tests failed. The failures were pure artifact: the branch was fine, and the run had to be discarded. Cost was 15 minutes and a false defect report. A stale checkout is recoverable; a gate result you have to *decide whether to believe* is worse than no gate.

Seeding is therefore not the cheap option, it is the correct one — a seeded worktree cannot be moved by another session. The residual difference is small and worth stating: a copied fixture proves the code runs, the primary's tree is the one the baseline was recorded from. When that distinction actually matters — a baseline re-record — take the primary deliberately, with no other session live, which `worktree_policy: always` is what enforces.

`.pixi/` self-ignores through a `.gitignore` the tool writes itself, so it needs no repo rule. The pytest and ruff caches were redirected out of the root on 2026-08-11 (`pyproject.toml` `cache_dir` / `cache-dir`) and now sit under the ignored `.tmp/`. **The root carries no cache directory of any kind, and `tests/test_cache_dir_hygiene.py` fails if one appears** -- matched by shape, so a tool nobody has added yet is caught too. Ignoring was never the guard: it keeps such a directory out of a commit, not out of the root, and the two the redirect left behind sat there unread for a week because nothing failed. The one invocation that still writes one is `ruff check --isolated` (which discards config by definition, and both `pyproject.toml` and `ci.yml` invite it as a rule-set diagnostic); run it as `RUFF_CACHE_DIR=.tmp/ruff_cache ruff check --isolated`, since the variable outranks the config-less default. That variable does NOT belong in `pixi.toml` `[activation.env]`: pixi does not expand values there, so it would have to be relative -- and a relative `RUFF_CACHE_DIR` resolves against the CWD, scattering `.tmp/ruff_cache` into whichever directory ruff ran from, while `cache-dir` already resolves correctly from any of them.
