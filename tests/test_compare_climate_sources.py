"""Rule 0.06: the cross-source comparison table and figures.

The properties, and the first three are ones the rest of the suite cannot reach:

* **the ≥2-carrier filter** — a variable only one candidate carries gets no
  comparison figure, while the TABLE still lists every candidate. That split is
  the whole owner ruling (2026-08-17), and it is easy to collapse into one
  filter by accident;
* **common ground** — the sources are masked to the basin cells and clipped to
  the period they share before anything is derived. Both corrections are
  invisible in a rendered figure (two plausible lines either way), so they are
  asserted numerically here or nowhere;
* **the multi-source DAG direction** — ``tests/snake_config_fixture.yml`` sets
  no ``candidate_sources``, so ``test_cli`` and ``test_log_rules_contract`` both
  parse WF0 in its SINGLE-source shape and neither sees rule 0.06 at all. This
  module parses it with two sources, which is where the conditional rule, its
  declared outputs and its appended ``LOG_RULES`` label have to agree;
* the table's window column is the EXTRACTED span, not the published record;
* the figures render, and are named exactly as the rule declared them.

Hermetic: the stores are written here, so nothing needs a data mirror, a model
or the network.
