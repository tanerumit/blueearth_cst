# One Julia session amortizes Wflow load/JIT across an explicitly identified batch.
# With CST_BATCH_STAGING set, each finished member's CSV is moved into that
# directory at once and its `.expect` marker becomes `.ok`, so Snakemake's
# failed-job cleanup cannot delete it and a retry re-runs only the failures
# (blueearth_cst/experiment/batch_staging.py). Unset, outputs stay in place.
