"""[R7-22] Every module under `blueearth_cst/` must import without Snakemake.

Snakemake's `script:` directive injects a `snakemake` object into the module's
globals before executing it. A module that reads that object at TOP LEVEL --
`config = snakemake.input.x` outside any function -- therefore works under
Snakemake and raises `NameError` under `import`, which makes it invisible to
unit tests. The repo's answer is the guarded idiom:

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        if "snakemake" in globals():
            sm = globals()["snakemake"]
            ...

`downscale_climate_forcing.py` was the last holdout and carried an `F821`
per-file-ignore in `pyproject.toml` to keep the lint gate green. Converting it
let that entry be deleted; this sweep is what stops a new one being needed.

Ruff's F821 catches the same class from the other side, statically. This test is
the dynamic half: it fails on a module that is unimportable for any reason --
an import-time side effect that needs a run directory, a top-level read of a
config file -- not only on an undefined name.
