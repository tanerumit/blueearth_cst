Every number below is **measured** on the seed fixture's region
(`INM/INM-CM4-8`, `r1i1p1f1`, `Amon`, buffer 1.0, variables `[precip, temp]`).

---

## 1. The split is justified — and by more than the estimate

Three sources, timed in three phases:

| Phase | 3 sources | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| **open** | ssp585 alone: **1142.1 s** | `get_rasterdataset` — resolves the catalog URI glob `gs://cmip6/.../Amon/{variable}/*/*` against the remote listing, reads store metadata |
| **fetch** | **58.5 s** | `.load()` — the actual data transfer (ssp585: 18.7 s) |
| **reduce** | **0.6 s** | the monthly resample / spatial mean / round arithmetic (ssp585: 0.3 s) |
| raw on disk | **0.20 MB** | the sliced raw netCDF (ssp585: 0.07 MB) |

**A re-reduction from a local raw cache costs ~1 % of a re-derivation** (0.6 s vs
59.1 s of remote work, before counting the open). Nine sources would hold about
**0.6 MB** of raw slices — three orders of magnitude below the "single-digit MB"
the design assumed, so disk is a non-issue.

> **Corrected against the built implementation (2026-07-30, same day).** The 0.6 s
> is the *arithmetic*. A real `reduce_gcm_series` job measures **29–34 s**, because
> interpreter start, `import hydromt` and dask setup dominate — the reduction itself
> is still ~0.6 s of it. So a re-reduction of all 9 series is **~4.6 min**, against
> **~18 min** for a full re-derivation (fetch 28 s + reduce 31 s per series on the
> clean path). A 4x win on the 5a/5b/5c steps, not 100x. Cite this figure, not the
> 1 %: the probe measured a phase, the benchmark below measures a job.

The r2 review estimated "~15 min → seconds" for the remaining value-changing
steps. That is confirmed as an *understatement* of the ratio.

## 2. The design consequence the estimate missed

**The dominant cost is the open, not the transfer.** 1142 s to resolve and open one
source versus 18.7 s to move its data.

So a raw cache that still calls `get_rasterdataset` — to check freshness, to
re-read metadata, to confirm a pin — **saves nothing**. It would remove the 19 s
and keep the 1142 s.

The split must therefore be built so a reduce job with a valid raw slice makes
**zero remote calls**: freshness decided from the local slice's own attributes
against the **D12 store-index pins** already on disk, never by reopening the store.
That is a stronger requirement than "raw content digest folded into the reduce
key" as the r2 review's mitigation list stated it, and it is what makes the split
worth its coherence surface. Stated as an acceptance criterion for the step:

> With every raw slice present and valid, a full re-reduction of all 9 series
> issues no network request. Falsifier: run it with the network unavailable — it
> must succeed, not degrade.

## 3. The `ssp585` asymmetry is refuted as scenario-specific — a new anomaly replaces it

The handoff recorded "three parallel `ssp585` reads exceed a 10-minute tool
timeout" and the r2 review flagged it as undiagnosed. Three measurements now:

| Evidence | Result |
|---|---|
| Today's real snakemake run (`bf1f4a5`) | 9 series re-derived in 3 per-model calls, **none exceeding 600 s** including opens; recorded per-series benchmarks **108–130 s**, no scenario outlier |
| Probe run 1 (full mode, ssp585 last) | ssp585 **open 1142 s** |
| Probe run 2 (open-only, **ssp245 first**) | ssp245 open **> 630 s**, killed before completing |

The slow open happened to `ssp245` when it went first and to `ssp585` when it went
last, so **the scenario is not the variable**. Nor is it purely cold-start.

What is *not* explained: the same call is 5–20× slower in the probe than inside
today's snakemake jobs, with an apparently identical argument set (`bbox`,
`buffer`, `time_range`, `variables` all mirrored from
`get_stats_climate_proj.py:250-258`). Candidates not yet separated: GCS listing
latency varying over the day, the anonymous-credential fallback the probe logs
(`Could not determine bucket type for bucket name cmip6 … falling back to
GCSFileSystem`), and per-process listing caches.

**Hypothesis, with its settling observation:** instrument the open *inside the
rule* — a `log_row` bracketing `get_rasterdataset` — and compare against
`probe_store_read_timing.py --mode open` in the same hour. If the in-rule open is
also minutes, the recorded 108–130 s benchmarks are measuring something else and
the fan-out is hiding the cost; if it stays seconds, the probe path differs and the
probe is the artifact. Until then, **cite neither number as "the" cost of a store
open.**

Note against over-reading run 1: its first two rows were lost to a `Select-Object
-Last 18` in the invocation, not to the probe. The totals survived because they
print last. The probe now flushes per row for exactly this reason.

## 3.1 Root cause: gcsfs's experimental extended filesystem, on by default

The settling observation of §3 was run as a controlled A/B on 2026-07-30 (probe
`--mode open`, `INM/INM-CM4-8` `ssp245` `r1i1p1f1`, one source per process).
Run A went **first** on purpose, so any warming worked *against* the hypothesis:

| Run | `GCSFS_EXPERIMENTAL_ZB_HNS_SUPPORT` | open | bucket-type warnings |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | `false` | **57.7 s** (completed) | 0 |
| B | *unset* (gcsfs default) | **> 836 s**, killed before completing | **266 and climbing** |

Read the two numbers carefully: A's is a completed `open_s`; B never printed one.
B's figure is 869 s of wall clock minus ~33 s of interpreter start, hydromt import
and catalog parse (log: start 13:04:01Z, catalog parsed 13:04:12Z, `Reading …`
13:04:33Z). **Ratio ≥ 14×, and a lower bound** — B was killed, not finished.

The mechanism, read from the pinned `gcsfs 2026.4.0` in `.pixi/envs/default`:

* `gcsfs/__init__.py:18` — `os.getenv("GCSFS_EXPERIMENTAL_ZB_HNS_SUPPORT", "true")`.
  The experimental `ExtendedGcsFileSystem` is **on by default**, and the switch is
  read at **import** time, so it must be set before anything imports gcsfs —
  including transitively, via `import hydromt`.
* `extended_gcsfs.py:164-195` — every operation calls `_lookup_bucket_type`, a
  `get_storage_layout` control-plane RPC. Under `token="anon"` the storage-control
  client does its own ADC lookup, finds no default credentials, and raises:
  `Could not determine bucket type for bucket name cmip6: Your default credentials
  were not found ... falling back to GCSFileSystem`.
* `extended_gcsfs.py:155-157` — `# Dont cache UNKNOWN type`. The failure is
  therefore **never cached** and repeats on every call, including `_list_objects`
  (line 1443, i.e. the `/*/*` glob resolution) and `_open` (line 214).

Measured throughput of the repetition: **0.31 warnings/s**, sustained over a 45 s
window. That is an aggregate rate, not a per-call cost — fsspec is async and the
open touches two variables, so lookups overlap; do **not** read it as "3.2 s per
lookup". What the measurement supports is the shape of the pathology: volume ×
no-caching. Whether an individual lookup approaches
`STORAGE_CONTROL_RPC_TIMEOUT` (30 s) was not measured.

Why the probe looked slower than the rule: `get_stats_climate_proj.py:15` sets the
variable; `dev/scripts/probe_store_read_timing.py` did not. That is the entire
"5-20× slower in the probe" discrepancy — same code, opposite side of the switch.
GCS latency, time of day and `ssp585` are all exonerated.

**Consequence for the split.** `blueearth_cst/projections/fetch_gcm_raw.py` does
not set the variable either. As WF2's only remote-opening module it would inherit
run B's path, i.e. the split would be built on the slow side of a one-line switch.

**Residual, separate from this one.** Run A's 57.7 s is *not* fast. With the
pathology removed, resolving `{grid_label}/{version}` is still a real cost, and
`config/catalogs/cmip6_store_index.json` already records the pin that would
remove it. Two independent fixes, not one.

## 3.2 The glob is a minor cost; per-job imports are a major one

§3.1's residual said "resolve the pin, it is the other half". Measured 2026-07-30,
same source, one process per arm, **pinned first** so warming worked against the
arm expected to win:

| Arm | uri tail | open |
|---|---|---|
| PINNED | `/{variable}/gr1/v20190603` | **52.9 s** |
| GLOBBED | `/{variable}/*/*` | **59.6 s** |

The single pair above suggested ~6.7 s and I called it "inside the noise".
**Repeating it refuted that**, three alternating samples per arm:

| arm | samples | mean |
|---|---|---|
| PINNED | 48.8, 50.2, 50.7 | **49.9 s** |
| GLOBBED | 57.8, 59.5, 62.7 | **60.0 s** |

The ranges do not overlap. The glob costs **~10 s of a ~60 s open, ≈ 17 %** —
a real, reproducible effect, and larger than the first pair showed. Two lessons
land here at once: a single pair was not enough to call the effect either way,
and "inside the noise" was as wrong as "dominant".

**The mechanism settles it where the end-to-end timing cannot.** Timed directly
against the bucket:

| operation | cost |
|---|---|
| `fs.glob(…/Amon/pr/*/*)` | 0.27 s |
| `fs.glob(…/Amon/tas/*/*)` | 0.14 s |
| `ls` of the pinned store | 0.00 s |

**The listing the glob triggers is 0.41 s.** So essentially none of the ~10 s gap
is bucket latency — it is **hydromt's resolver overhead on a wildcard URI**,
~24× what answering the same pattern costs `gcsfs` directly. That is the accurate
attribution: the pin is worth ~10 s per source (~1.5 min across 9), and the cost
it removes lives in the resolver, not in the network.

> **Correcting a number that briefly propagated.** `series_identity.pinned_uri`'s
> first docstring called the listing "the dominant cost of a read — ~28 s per
> source". That 28 s is this note's own §1 correction block — "fetch 28 s + reduce
> 31 s **per series**" — i.e. a whole fetch job, mis-attributed to the listing
> inside it. Both the docstring and `fetch_gcm_raw.py`'s comment now carry the
> 0.41 s figure and an explicit "do not re-justify this as a performance fix".

**What the catalog-shape blocker actually costs.** §3.1 implied the pin needs a
redesign. Restricted to the member WF2 actually reads it is far smaller — every
non-template config sets `members: [r1i1p1f1]`:

| Restricted to | entries | one pinned uri suffices |
|---|---|---|
| all members | 289 | 158 (54.7 %) |
| `r1i1p1f1` | 219 | **186 (84.9 %)** |
| `r1i1p1f2` | 59 | 59 (100 %) |

Still not 100 %, so pinning stays a hybrid — 33 entries keep the glob, and the D8
duplicate-time-axis guard stays regardless.

**The bigger number nobody was looking at.** A probe process reaches its first
remote call ~57 s after start. Measured directly in a cold process:
`import geopandas` 7.5 s, `import hydromt` 17.7 s — **25.2 s of imports**, paid
once per Snakemake job. Counting that in, the glob is ~6 % of a *source's whole
job* (imports + open), against the ~11 % of the *open alone* above; the two
percentages differ only in denominator.

**A narrow-import fix was tried and does not work — recorded so nobody retries
it.** Four projection modules import `hydromt` **only** to register the `.raster`
xarray accessor (their own `# noqa: F401` comments say so), and
`hydromt.gis.raster` does register it — a documented path, not a private one
(`docs/hydromt-user-guide/06-migration-guide.md:293` maps `hydromt.raster` →
`hydromt.gis.raster`). Both methods WF2 uses survive it (`.raster.vars`, 7 uses,
Dataset-only; `.raster.box`, 3 uses). But the saving is **zero**:

| measured after `import xarray, pandas, numpy` (the prelude these modules load anyway) | marginal cost |
|---|---|
| `import hydromt.gis.raster` | 4.8 s |
| `import hydromt` | **4.8 s** |

`hydromt`'s apparent 17.7 s is almost entirely xarray/pandas/rasterio, which the
modules import regardless. Measuring the narrow import in a *bare* process
attributed that shared cost to hydromt and overstated the saving as ~13 s. The
lesson generalises: time an import against the prelude it will actually run in.

**Consequence for the split's own path.** After the split
`get_stats_climate_proj.py` is the reduce stage and makes no remote call at all
(its line 229: "No DataCatalog, no get_rasterdataset, no network") — yet a
re-reduction still pays ~25 s of imports before its 0.6 s of arithmetic. That
floor is real, but it is xarray/pandas/geopandas, not hydromt, so no import edit
removes it. The only structural lever left is **fewer processes** (batching
sources per job), which trades directly against the per-series caching the split
exists to provide. Not recommended without a separate design pass.

## 4. Carry-forwards

- The split is **cleared to build**, with §2's zero-network acceptance criterion
  added to the mitigation list in r2 §4.
- `--mode open` is the cheap re-measurement when asking "is the store slow
  today?" before attributing a slow run to code. It must be run **with**
  `GCSFS_EXPERIMENTAL_ZB_HNS_SUPPORT=false`, or it measures §3.1 instead of the
  store.
- The 10-minute-timeout workaround in the handoff §5 was justified by "cold glob
  resolution can take 10–20 minutes for any source". §3.1 shows that figure was an
  artifact of the unset switch; re-derive the budget from run A's 57.7 s, not from
  the 1142 s.
- **§1 and §2 were measured on the unset switch.** Their conclusion survives — a
  re-reduction is still ~100× cheaper than a re-derivation (0.6 s local vs ~77 s
  remote at run A's open) — but every absolute figure in them, 1142 s above all,
  is inflated by §3.1's bug. Restate them against a corrected open, or a later
  reader will find §1 and §3.1 in contradiction.
- Of the two follow-ups §3.1 named, the first is done and the second is **kept on
  different grounds than it was proposed on**. Declaring the switch: **done**,
  ≥14× measured, landed as `6b98b15`. Pinning the `/*/*` glob: **implemented and
  retained** (`series_identity.pinned_uri` + `fetch_gcm_raw` wiring, 55 tests
  green) — worth **~10 s per source**, ~17 % of the open, ~1.5 min across the 9
  series (§3.2, n = 3 per arm, non-overlapping). Size the claim correctly in any
  future write-up: the saving is hydromt resolver overhead, not network latency
  (`fs.glob` answers the same patterns in 0.41 s), and it is nowhere near the
  "~28 s, dominant" the first docstring claimed. It also buys determinism — the
  job addresses one known store rather than a pattern whose match set can change
  under it. The hybrid
  fallback stays (33 entries diverge per variable, 188 member-combinations
  multi-match), and the D8 duplicate-time-axis guard stays regardless — the
  fallback is what keeps that guard reachable.
- **The open is now understood and is not cheaply reducible.** ~53–60 s per
  source, of which the glob is ~6 s; the rest is zarr metadata reads, the hydromt
  resolver and round-trip latency. The raw cache built in `347638d` is the right
  mitigation — further micro-optimisation of the open has no target left.
- Do not re-open the import angle without reading §3.2's second table: the
  narrow-import fix measures to a zero saving.
