"""Pointer-derived fingerprint of the live Wflow model's runtime inputs.

Implements the *Model reproducibility contract* in
``dev/milestones/r09/project-tree-design.md``: each experiment records which
model state it used, so a changed live model cannot silently re-run an old
experiment against different physics or state.

**Pointer-derived, not a fixed file list.** The digest covers ``wflow_sbm.toml``
plus every model-root file the TOML *points at*, discovered by walking the
parsed document for path-valued keys rather than by naming them. A fixed triple
of TOML + ``staticmaps.nc`` + ``instates.nc`` was rejected in design: it is
correct only for the TOML shape the toolbox happens to emit today. Any hydromt
``setup_*`` that writes a TOML-referenced side file — lake rating curves,
glacier tables — adds a runtime input. A fixed digest would catch the POINTER
changing, because the TOML is hashed, but not a later in-place edit of the file
pointed at. Discovery closes that class; enumeration only lists its current
members.

**The exclusions are structural, not a blocklist.** ``staticgeoms/``,
``hydromt.log`` and ``hydromt_data.yml`` are excluded because Wflow.jl does not
read them at run time — and they are excluded *by construction*, since nothing
in the TOML points at them. That is deliberate: if some future TOML did point at
one, Wflow would read it, it would be a runtime input, and it SHOULD enter the
digest. A hardcoded blocklist would then be wrong in the one case that matters.

**Resolution is lexical, against the model root.** ``normpath``/``join``, never
``resolve()``, so a pointer to a not-yet-created output does not depend on the
filesystem. ``dir_output`` is deliberately NOT applied: Wflow resolves output
pointers against ``dirname(toml) + dir_output``, so output keys such as
``state.path_output`` and ``output.csv.path`` resolve here to paths that
normally do not exist and are recorded with the absence marker. The consequence
is intended — the fingerprint stays stable across runs of the model, instead of
changing every time the historical run rewrites its own outputs.

**Determinism across platforms** is a hard requirement: entries are sorted by
relative POSIX path, and no absolute path ever enters the hashed material.
