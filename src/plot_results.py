    Analyse and plot wflow model performance for historical run.

    To be read, model should be stored in ``project_dir``/hydrology_model.
    Model results should include the discharge keys Q_outlets and, if gauges are
    provided, Q_gauges_{basename(gauges_locs)}. The climate plots (P/T/EP) are
    derived from the model's forcing INPUT (inmaps: precip/temp/pet), aggregated
    per subcatchment — not from wflow outputs (ADR 0002).


    Outputs:

    - plot of hydrographs at the outlet(s) and gauges_locs if provided. If wflow run is
      three years or less, only the daily hydrograph will be plotted. If wflow run is
      longer than three years, plots will also include the yearly hydrograph, the
      monthly average and hyddrographs for the wettest and driest years. If observations
      are available, they are added as well.
    - plot of signature plots if wflow run is longer than a year and if observations
      are available.
    - plot of climate data per year and per month at the subcatchment level if wflow run
      is longer than a year.
    - plot of basin average outputs (e.g. soil moisture, snow, etc.). The variables to
      include should have the postfix _basavg in the wflow output file.
    - compute performance metrics (daily and monthly KGE, NSE, NSElog, RMSE, MSE, Pbias,
      VE) if observations are available and if wflow run is longer than a year. Metrics
      are saved to a csv file.

        Path to gauges/observations locations file, by default None
