rem ===========================================================================
rem run_snake_test.cmd -- Windows convenience runner for the three CST workflows
rem on the tracked test config, in the required order:
rem     build_model -> analyze_projections -> run_stress_test
rem
rem Everything runs through `pixi run`, so no environment needs activating first
rem (this replaced a `call activate cst` conda step) and `dot` resolves from the
rem pixi env's graphviz rather than a system install.
rem
rem Usage:
rem     scripts\run_snake_test.cmd                 rem run all three
rem     scripts\run_snake_test.cmd --dry-run       rem validate the DAGs only
rem     scripts\run_snake_test.cmd -c 6            rem override cores
rem
rem Any arguments are forwarded verbatim to every `snakemake all` invocation, so
rem `--dry-run` is the cheap way to check this script end-to-end. A later `-c`
rem wins over the default, so `-c 6` overrides without editing the file.
rem
rem Prefer `scripts\run_workflows.py` when you want the `enabled:`-aware wrapper;
rem this script always runs all three regardless of the `workflows:` flags.
rem
rem Exits nonzero on the first failing workflow and does NOT continue to the
rem next -- a downstream workflow must not consume a failed upstream's outputs
rem (same contract as run_workflows.py). No `pause`: this must be usable
rem non-interactively.
