"""Render a console transcript per workflow through the REAL handler.

Drives `_ConsoleHandler` with the same synthetic records `tests/test_snake_utils.py`
uses, so what comes out is what a run prints. Every rule row below is the
module's own string literal with only its interpolated values staged; the clock
and the durations are staged too, so a transcript is byte-reproducible -- two
renders of an unchanged spec are identical, which is what makes a diff between
renders readable as the console change and nothing else.

Both modules that read a clock are staged. `snake_utils` owns `log_row`, which
stamps a rule's own output; `console_style` owns the handler, which stamps the
RUN/DONE rows and measures each job's elapsed. Staging only the first left a
transcript carrying two clocks -- body rows at the staged time, job rows at
whatever the wall clock said -- so job timings could not be read off the page
and every re-render diffed against the last.

One spec per workflow in `console_sample_specs.py`; a new workflow costs a
spec rather than a script. Writes `<name>.clean.txt` per workflow, plus
`<name>.failed.txt` for a workflow whose spec carries a `Failure`, plus
`transcripts.json`, into this script's own directory unless `--out` says
otherwise.

A run has two shapes a reviewer has to see, not one. The success shape ends
with rule `all` listing its targets; the failure shape never reaches `all`, and
its tail is the only place the log-parts directory is named. A spec without a
`Failure` renders the clean shape alone, and `main` says which those are.

Run it to see what a console change actually looks like without executing a
workflow -- which is how the 2026-09-17 styling pass was reviewed:

    pixi run python dev/scripts/render_console_sample.py --out .tmp/console

`dev/scripts/` because it inspects the repo and is never part of a run.
