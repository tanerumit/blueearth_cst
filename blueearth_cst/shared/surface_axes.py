"""Derive a response-surface axis from the stress-test lookup.

**This module is the REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION of HM-7, not its definition.** No
rule in this repository calls it: WF3 ends at the reduction, and the consumers
that actually draw a surface are out-of-repo (CST-API, the frontend,
``csthelpers``). They re-implement from
``dev/reference/contracts/hydrological-model-seam.md``, as does this
repository's own ``docs/notebooks/Climate Stress Test.ipynb``, which is
deliberately written against the contract text rather than against this module.
So when the two disagree, the contract wins and this file is the defect.

**Why the axis is derived rather than stored.** It used to be two columns on
every indicator row, computed at reduction time as a month-length-weighted
annual mean of the member's twelve monthly perturbations. That misreports any
seasonal design -- +30% imposed in JJA reads as +7.6% -- and baking ONE collapse
into the results made every other axis unrecoverable from them. Given the
lookup, an axis is fully determined, so storing one is a cache of a derivation.

**Pure module.** No Snakemake import, and deliberately no
``shared/snake_utils`` import either: the join key's width is inferred from the
lookup rather than taken from ``index_width(ST_NUM)``, so nothing here needs to
be told the member count. A derivation that had to be told the member count
could be told the wrong one.
