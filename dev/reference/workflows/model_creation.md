# Workflow: build_model

Contract for `build_model.smk` (workflow 1). Format per
`dev/milestones/r01/modularity-contracts-design.md` §4. Records current behavior
and is grounded in `build_model.smk`, the templates under
`config/templates/`, and the rule-called modules under `blueearth_cst/model/`
and `blueearth_cst/spatial/`.

## Owned config keys (`workflows.build_model.*`)

In this workflow's own config file, reached through its
`config_path:` stanza.

- `engine.build_config` — path to the hydromt build config
  (default `config/defaults/wflow_build_model.yml`).
- `engine.waterbodies_config` — path to the reservoirs/lakes/glaciers
  update config (default `config/defaults/wflow_update_waterbodies.yml`).
- `observations` — optional observed series for `plot_wflow_evaluation`,
  **per variable**: `{'river discharge': <path>}`. A variable named here
  that `model.outvars` does not ask for is refused at parse time — an
  observed series with no modelled counterpart has nothing to be
  compared against. Default `None`.
- `simulation_window` — `{start, end}`, INCLUSIVE calendar years.

`model.outvars` is **no longer owned here**: R14 `C-19` moved it to the
project file, because WF3 reads it too and a key two workflows read has
to have one home.

## Reads from `shared`

- `shared.basin.region`, `shared.basin.resolution` — basin delineation + model resolution.
- `shared.basin.output_locations` — optional canonical gauge/control-point file.
  The former `workflows.build_model.output_locations` key is accepted for
  one compatibility release; conflicting populated values fail at parse time.
- `shared.basin.automatic_subbasins.max_count` — global automatic-fallback
  ceiling (default 20; valid range 1–99).
- `shared.basin.gauge_snap_tolerance_m` — point-to-river snapping tolerance
  (default 10,000 m).
- `shared.basin.river_uparea_km2` — analysis river threshold (default 32 km²).
- `shared.basin.spatial_sources.{rivers,lulc,lai,soil}` — catalog entries for
  the model-neutral thematic products.
- `shared.historical_window.starttime`, `shared.historical_window.endtime` — how
  much climate record to EXTRACT (rule 1.04, the climate store, the climate
  figures). Subject to `MIN_HISTORICAL_YEARS`, which is weathergenr's floor.
- `workflows.build_model.simulation_window` — the period the model is RUN
  over (rule 1.10): the forcing prepared for it and the wflow TOML's `[time]`
  window, which are necessarily the same span. **Optional**; absent means exact
  passthrough of `historical_window`, so a config predating the key is
  unaffected. Must sit INSIDE the record: rule 1.10 builds the forcing from the
  extracted store, so a simulation period outside it has no data behind it.
  (This was unconstrained when the key shipped, while the forcing still came
  from the data catalog.) No length floor applies — the ≥16-year minimum is
  weathergenr's, on the record.
- `shared.climate.selected` — historical climate source (e.g. `era5`).

## Reads from `project`

- `project.project_dir` — output root
  (`basin_dir = {project_dir}/models/hydrology/wflow`,
  `spatial_dir = {project_dir}/data/spatial`).
- `project.catalog` — hydromt data-catalog YAML (passed to
  `hydromt build/update -d`).

`project.static_dir` is gone (`C-07`): the two engine configs it used to
prefix are named by full path in this workflow's own file.

## Rule 1.02: engine-neutral spatial foundation

`prepare_spatial_maps` is a no-wildcard target and can be requested directly:

```powershell
snakemake prepare_spatial_maps -c 1 -s build_model.smk --configfile <config.yml>
```

It resolves every parent feature independently, snaps configured gauge/control
points to the analysis river network, and uses internal controls where present.
An outlet-only or absent control set selects deterministic automatic
partitioning for that parent. The configured `automatic_subbasins.max_count`
is one global ceiling shared between fallback parents. Automatic outlets are
restricted to cells in the configured P1 river mask, so the result may contain
fewer units than the ceiling. Incremental subbasins do not overlap; the
separate catchment layer contains each control point's full contributing area
and therefore may overlap or nest.

The analysis grid comes from `shared.basin.hydrography` at the requested
resolution (native or an integer upscale). Flow direction is ArcGIS D8, not a
Wflow LDD map. Elevation and slope use average resampling; LULC uses nearest;
LAI and soil variables use average. Each raster records its catalog source,
resampling where applicable, resolution, units, nodata, and CRS.

The rule's freshness boundary is the workflow config, the catalog YAML file(s),
and the optional gauge file, all declared as Snakemake inputs. A change to a
data file hidden behind an unchanged catalog URI is not detectable by
Snakemake; touch/update the catalog or force this rule when refreshing such a
source. The generated catalog uses relative URIs, so the complete
`data/spatial/` directory is portable as a unit.

Targeting this rule directly does not schedule Wflow or create
`models/hydrology/wflow/`. In the full DAG, rule 1.03 declares all nine spatial
products as inputs. Wflow constants and derived parameter maps remain outside
this product.

The Gate 1 adapter proof selected a project-owned adapter over another
`setup_basemaps` call. In the pinned `hydromt_wflow` version,
`setup_basemaps` delineates from a hydrography source and would therefore
repeat P1. The proof instead reads only `spatial_catalog.yml`, converts the
neutral ArcGIS D8 map to Wflow LDD at the adapter boundary, loads the neutral
base layers through the public `staticmaps.set`/`geoms.set` component APIs,
and then uses public `setup_config`, `set_flwdir`, `setup_gauges`,
`setup_outlets`, and `write` methods. A write/reopen check preserves the P1
grid and current subbasin/location IDs and produces the standard Wflow
`staticmaps.nc`, `wflow_sbm.toml`, and `staticgeoms/region.geojson` triplet.

## Rule 1.03: Wflow-SBM build

`build_wflow_model` consumes the complete P1 contract through
`spatial_catalog.yml`; it cannot run `setup_basemaps`. The adapter converts D8
to LDD, initializes Wflow static maps and geometries, and then invokes the
public Wflow-specific river, LULC, LAI, soil, and constant-parameter methods.
P1 rivers/LULC/LAI are passed directly. The pinned `setup_soilmaps` API accepts
only a catalog source name, so Wflow soil pedotransfer continues to read
`soilgrids` from `project.data_sources`.

The subcatchment map is populated before `setup_outlets`, so outlet IDs inherit
P1 subbasin IDs. Gauges use explicit `wflow_id` values with the fixed basename
`locations`. After writing, the adapter reopens the model and validates the
triplet, grid, subcatchment IDs, gauge IDs, and outlet IDs. The `.model_built`
sentinel retains the existing in-place TOML/staticmaps mutation cascade for
waterbodies, outputs, runtime, and forcing.

## Input contract (external data — catalog sources required in `data_sources`)

- **Spatial foundation**: `shared.basin.hydrography` and optional basin index,
  plus the configured river, LULC, LAI, and soil sources.
- **Wflow build** (`wflow_build_model.yml`): all generated P1 catalog entries;
  `soilgrids` for the pinned public soil-pedotransfer API; the plugin's
  `vito_mapping_default` parameter table.
- **Waterbodies** (`wflow_update_waterbodies.yml`): `hydro_reservoirs` (GRanD),
  `jrc` (reservoir timeseries), `hydro_lakes` (HydroLAKES), `rgi` (glaciers).
  Any source may be legitimately absent for a basin — the
  `add_reservoirs_lakes_glaciers` rule catches per-method `NoDataException`.
- **Forcing**: `shared.climate.selected` source (e.g. `era5`) over the
  historical window.

## Output contract (by role — not all are `rule all` targets)

**Direct `rule all` targets** (named statically by this workflow's `rule all`):
- `{basin_dir}/evaluation/plots/hydro_wflow_1.png` (the run)
- `{basin_dir}/plots/basin_area.png` (the model)
- `{basin_dir}/forcing/plots/forcing_precip_map.png` (model inputs)
- `{project_dir}/data/climate/historical/<key>/plots/source_{precip,temp,pet}.png`
  (source-grid figures from the shared store; produced with no model)
- `{project_dir}/config/runs/project_config_build_model.yml` (verbatim snake-config snapshot)
- `{project_dir}/data/spatial/spatial_catalog.yml` (representative target for the
  complete rule-1.02 spatial product)

*There is no project-level `plots/` tree: a figure attaches to what it DEPICTS,
beside the subtree whose artifacts it shows.*

**Downstream-contract artifacts** (produced by intermediate rules; consumed by
workflows 2/3; not in this `rule all`):
- `{basin_dir}/staticmaps.nc`
- `{basin_dir}/staticgeoms/region.geojson`
- `{basin_dir}/staticgeoms/outlets.geojson`
- `{basin_dir}/wflow_sbm.toml`
- `{basin_dir}/forcing/inmaps_historical.nc`

*`{basin_dir}/run_default/output.csv` was listed here and is not a
downstream-contract artifact: `dev/scripts/cross_workflow_inputs.py` stages only
the TOML, `.outputs_configured` and `region.geojson`, so no WF2/WF3 rule ever
consumed it. Rule 1.14 declares it `temp()`, so a successful run does not leave
it at all — the readable per-variable tables (rule 1.14b) are what
`run_default/` holds.*

**Spatial-foundation contract** (`blueearth-cst-spatial-v1`):

- `{project_dir}/data/spatial/spatial_maps.nc`
- `{project_dir}/data/spatial/geoms/{basins,subbasins,catchments,rivers,locations}.geojson`
- `{project_dir}/data/spatial/geoms/region.geojson` — a **sixth** layer in the
  same directory, written by rule 1.02 `delineate_region` (ADR 0003) rather
  than by 1.06. Listed separately because the producer differs: enumerating
  five layers here is what let R9's migration map miss it (P1 finding F1a).
- `{project_dir}/data/spatial/location_registry.csv`
- `{project_dir}/data/spatial/spatial_catalog.yml`
- `{project_dir}/data/spatial/spatial_report.yml`

The raster, vector, and registry identifiers are relational: basin IDs are
`1..N`; subbasin IDs use `basin_id * 100 + local_number`; each primary location
inherits its subbasin ID as `wflow_id`. The generated `spatial_catalog.yml`
exposes every artifact through HydroMT without containing Wflow configuration.

**Side-effect artifacts** (bookkeeping / traceability; no downstream reader):
- `{basin_dir}/staticgeoms/reservoirs_lakes_glaciers.txt` — waterbodies sentinel.
- `{basin_dir}/staticgeoms/outlet_index.csv` — deterministic compatibility,
  basin, subbasin, location, station, and Wflow-ID crosswalk.
- `{project_dir}/logs/_parts/1.NN_{rule}.log`, `{project_dir}/benchmarks/_parts/1.NN_{rule}.tsv`
  (per-rule logs AND benchmarks live under `_parts/`; `gather_logs` (1.16) merges
  the logs into one `logs/wf1_build_model.log` via
  `blueearth_cst/shared/merge_logs.py` and then **deletes** the parts, and
  `gather_benchmarks` (1.14) merges the benchmarks into one
  `benchmarks/wf1_benchmarks.md` (Markdown table, `rule` column + `TOTAL` row)
  via `merge_benchmarks.py`. All three workflows follow this scheme — WF2 2.07,
  WF3 3.13.)
  — ephemeral run artifacts (R3 §6); not manifest targets, not committed. The
  `1.NN_` prefix is the `W.NN` rule-numbering scheme (naming.md §9). The
  spatial and Wflow-build rules use `1.02_prepare_spatial_maps` and
  `1.03_build_wflow_model`.

## Downstream consumers

- **Workflow 2** (`analyze_projections.smk`) reads
  `staticgeoms/region.geojson` (as an `ancient(...)` input to
  `monthly_stats_hist`/`_fut`).
- **Workflow 3** (`run_stress_test.smk`) reads the built model,
  its `wflow_sbm.toml`, and the forcing layout.

## Outlet-naming convention (R3 §4 decision)

Outlet stations use the **positional `wflow_{1..N}`** convention (not the
basin-derived subcatchment IDs hydromt_wflow 1.x assigns). The real
subcatchment IDs are preserved in `staticgeoms/outlet_index.csv` alongside
`basin_code`, `subbasin_code`, `location_code`, `station_name`, and `wflow_id`.
The compatibility label is surfaced in plot titles as a human aid. Rationale:
static `rule all` /
manifest paths must be basin-independent (see design §4). The CSV column
`Q_outlets` is upstream hydromt_wflow vocabulary, kept as-is.

## `model.outvars` output set (known discrepancy — documented, not fixed in R3)

- Canonical `config/project_config_model_test.yml`: `['river discharge']` — the
  minimal set (outlet Q only).
- Pytest fixture `tests/project_config_model_test.yml`: all six mapped variables
  (`river discharge`, `precipitation`, `overland flow`,
  `actual evapotranspiration`, `groundwater recharge`, `snow`).

The two seed configs carry different output sets. Enabling the complete plot
suite (climate panels in `plot_results.py`) would require the fuller set but
**moves the baseline**, so it is a followup, not an R3 change (design §7.3).

## `model.outvars` → CSDMS mapping (`WFLOW_VARS`, `setup_gauges_and_outputs.py`)

Semantic name → Wflow.jl 1.x CSDMS Standard Name → reporting unit. Units are
the conventional Wflow 1.x output units; the header/param/unit pairings are
confirmed in the R3 §7.2 gauges audit (commit 7).

| Semantic name              | CSDMS name                                               | Unit      |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| river discharge            | `river_water__volume_flow_rate`                          | m³ s⁻¹    |
| precipitation              | `atmosphere_water__precipitation_volume_flux`            | mm Δt⁻¹   |
| overland flow              | `land_surface_water__volume_flow_rate`                   | m³ s⁻¹    |
| actual evapotranspiration  | `land_surface__evapotranspiration_volume_flux`           | mm Δt⁻¹   |
| groundwater recharge       | `soil_water_saturated_zone_top__net_recharge_volume_flux`| mm Δt⁻¹   |
| snow                       | `snowpack_liquid_water__depth`                           | mm        |

`river discharge` is always emitted at outlets (`setup_outlets`, header `Q`);
discharge and precipitation are emitted at registry locations (headers `Q`
and `P`);
remaining entries become basin-average timeseries (`{name}_basavg`, mean
reducer over `subcatchment`).

When observations are configured, rule 1.11 declares
`data/spatial/location_registry.csv` as an input and validates the raw semicolon-
separated header before HydroMT parses the table. Duplicate or registry-unknown
IDs fail explicitly. Every user-provided control/observation location must have
one column; synthetic automatic outlets are optional.

The baseline discharge reader uses `staticgeoms/outlet_index.csv` to select
the deterministic `wflow_1`/`subcatchment_id` outlet when registry gauges add
multiple `Q_*` columns to raw `output.csv`. Do not assume discharge is the only
Q column.
