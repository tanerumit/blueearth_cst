    * the **project** — dropped, so ``C:\\...\\gabon\\hydrology_model\\...\\
      basins.geojson`` reads ``hydrology_model\\...\\basins.geojson``. The
      project root is stated once in the log header, so no information is lost.
    * the **repository** — dropped and marked, so a config or script under the
      checkout reads ``<repo>/config/catalogs/deltares_data.yml``. Marked rather
      than bare because a repo-relative path and a project-relative one would
      otherwise be indistinguishable in the same line.
    * an installed **dependency** — everything up to ``site-packages`` becomes
      ``<site-packages>/``, so hydromt_wflow's own
      ``.../envs/default/Lib/site-packages/hydromt_wflow/data/parameters_data.yml``
      reads ``<site-packages>/hydromt_wflow/data/parameters_data.yml``. What
      matters is which package the file came from, not where pixi put the env.

    A fourth, remote rather than local: the object-store prefixes in
    :data:`_REMOTE_PREFIXES`, so a CMIP6 URI reads ``<cmip6>/ScenarioMIP/...``.
    Applied first, since a URI shares no structure with the three below it.

    Order matters: the repo contains the pixi env, so ``site-packages`` is
    matched FIRST or a repo-relative rewrite would hide it. A path in none of
    the three (a data catalog under ``C:\\data\\``) is left absolute — its
    location is the information.

    ``tokens`` are the run's DECLARED key folders (see
    :func:`declare_path_tokens`), and they are applied BEFORE the project strip
    for a mechanical reason: by then a path under the project has already lost
    its root, so a token registered in absolute form — which is the only form
    that can match what a rule prints — would find nothing left to match. They

    A *pure* trailing run of benign interpreter-shutdown excepthook noise (see

    passes ``snakemake.log[0]``.

    Contract (R3 design §6):
    - creates ``log_path`` and any missing parent directories;
    - both streams are restored in a ``finally`` — the redirection cannot leak
      past the ``with`` block even if the body raises;
    - the exception is **re-raised** (not swallowed), so the traceback still
      reaches Snakemake and the rule fails loudly rather than leaving an empty
      log that Snakemake would read as a finished product;
    - on failure the formatted **traceback is written into the log part** before
      unwinding. Snakemake prints ``check log file(s) for error details`` and
      nothing more, so a log that stops mid-rule actively misdirects: it sends
      an operator to the one file that cannot explain the failure. A deliberate
      ``SystemExit(0)`` is a success and writes nothing (see ``_is_clean_exit``).

    A silence watchdog (``_Heartbeat``) prints an elapsed-time notice to the
    live console when the rule goes quiet for ``heartbeat_interval`` seconds, so
    a stalled job is visible while it runs. It writes to the console only — the
    log file never receives a heartbeat line. ``CST_HEARTBEAT_SECS`` overrides
    the interval (``0`` disables it).

    Library logging bound to the console before entry (hydromt's ``StreamHandler``
    on ``sys.stdout``) is repointed through the tee for the duration, so its
    records get the same compacted ``HH:MM:SS - <module> - <LEVEL> - <msg>`` form

    **What a row SAYS.** Six conventions, arrived at by reading every emitted
    row in the package against a rendered transcript of all five workflows
    (2026-09-17). They are here, on the function every author calls, rather
    than in a document nobody opens while writing a row:

    1. **A row states its subsystem once.** It must not open with a noun that
       restates its own ``module`` column: ``collection - Collection <id>: ...``
       says it twice. This is the rule :func:`_compact_log_line` already
       applies to hydromt's records; we cleaned someone else's output of it
       and exempted our own until this was written down. The boundary is that
       rule's own: it strips a LABEL, not a verb, so ``fetch - Fetching ...``
       stays -- without the verb the row is a bare identifier that never says
       what is happening to it.
    2. **A value never repeats the key that introduces it.**
       ``reference_window reference_window_start=... reference_window_years=...``
       said one word five times; ``reference_window start=... years=...`` says it
       once. Strip the prefix at the ROW, never in the record it came from --
       a durable record wants self-describing keys.
    3. **A count and its noun agree**, through :func:`plural`. Never
       ``{n} thing(s)``: the count deciding the plural is on the same line, and
       on the rows where it is 1 the hedge reads as a defect in the code.
       The fix drags agreement with it -- ``are`` becomes ``is``, ``They were``
       becomes ``It was`` -- so it is never a search-and-replace.
    4. **A warning states the FAULT first**, then what it means for this run.
       Not what the output artifacts will show ("and the figures say so" is the
       figures' business), and not a count when the count is not the news: a
       row reporting that two subsystems disagree opened with how many
       locations were affected and buried the disagreement in its third clause.
    5. **No definite article on a verb row**, and no clause that cannot be
       false. ``Reading monthly change-factor table``, not ``Reading the ...``;
       ``Model reference matches the live model``, without ``simulation may
       proceed`` -- a mismatch raises.
    6. **A row opens with a capital unless it opens with an identifier.** The
       rows that opened lowercase were written as continuation fragments of a
       multi-part f-string and are one line on the console. A source id
       (``chirps is precipitation-only: ...``) is exempt: it is a literal key
       from the config and the catalog, and capitalising it prints a name that
       does not exist.

    One more, about LENGTH: a row is one console line and is never wrapped --
    wrapping splits what ``grep`` is meant to find on one line in the rule's
    log part, so the answer to a long row is a shorter row. Where the length is
    the data's rather than the author's, cap the list with :func:`listed`,
    which always states what it dropped.

    ``HH:MM:SS - <module> - <message>``, with the level shown only when it is
    not INFO (:func:`_log_row_text`) — the same shape ``_compact_log_line``
    produces for hydromt records, so a ``script:`` rule's own messages sit
    uniformly among the hydromt/library lines rather than as bare,
    timestamp-less text. Use this instead of a plain ``print`` for anything
    meant to appear in a rule log. The row is already compact, so the tee passes
    it through (only any project paths in it are relativized).

    A row at ``WARNING`` or above also increments the run's warning tally
    (:func:`note_warning`), which is what puts the count on the verdict line.
    Counted after the ``CST_LOG_LEVEL`` floor, so the tally reports warnings
    the reader was actually shown.

    Rows below ``CST_LOG_LEVEL`` are dropped, which is the toolbox's quiet mode:
    ``CST_LOG_LEVEL=WARNING`` leaves only warnings and errors. Two properties
    make that safe to add to an existing caller population:

    * **Unset means emit everything**, so nothing changes until someone opts in.
    * **An unrecognized ``level`` is never suppressed.** A caller passing a
      level this table does not know keeps printing — a filter that silently
      swallowed an unfamiliar level would hide exactly the unusual row worth
      seeing.

    Still ``sys.stdout`` rather than ``logging``, deliberately: the tee captures
    ``sys.stdout``, so a row that went through a logging handler would bypass
    the mechanism that puts it in the rule's log file. The floor therefore
    belongs INSIDE this function, not in a migration to ``logging``.

    **One ``write`` per row, not ``print``.** ``print`` emits the text and the
    newline as two calls, and :func:`_muted_on_console` refuses any chunk that
    is not exactly one newline-terminated line — deliberately, since a tee is
    handed chunks rather than lines. So a row emitted through ``print`` can
    never match ``_TEE_CONSOLE_MUTED``, and until this changed the mute table
    reached hydromt's records (``StreamHandler.emit`` writes ``msg +
    terminator`` in one call) but not a single row of our own. The visible
    output is identical either way; what changes is that our rows are now
    mutable on the same terms as everyone else's. Same defect and same fix as
    ``add_climate_forcing._run_streaming`` in the wf1-wf3 console lean.

    what actually decided.

    ``code`` overrides the tier for the heartbeat's stall notices, which are
    the same shape of chunk -- one console-bound line, never a log line -- but
    are not routine. Passing the code rather than adding a second function is
    what keeps the carriage-return and whitespace rules below applying to
    every painted chunk, since those are properties of the CHUNK, not of the
    colour.

    **A line's own severity outranks ``code``.** ``_severity_code`` is consulted
    per line, so a ``WARNING`` or ``ERROR`` arriving as ordinary body text --
    from our scripts, or from hydromt / R / Julia / wflow stdout -- is painted
    for what it says rather than for the tier its emitter assumed. Applied here
    because this is the ONE funnel every console-bound chunk passes through:
    the tee, the heartbeat and the console handler all call it, and none of them
    can see inside the text they forward. Nothing here reaches a log file --
    ``_paint_body`` returns ``text`` unchanged when ``colour`` is false, and the
    log branch never asks for colour -- so the file stays free of escapes.

    **Chunks containing a carriage return pass through untouched.** Those are
    in-place progress bars (dask's ``[####] | 100% Completed``), which redraw
    many times a second: wrapping each redraw would put an SGR pair around every
    frame, and a reset landing mid-bar flickers. They stay uncoloured and stay
    animated, which is the trade the tee already makes for them.

    Whitespace-only chunks are left alone too -- ``print`` commonly arrives as
    two writes, the text then the newline, and colouring a bare newline emits an
    escape pair around nothing.

    Wrapping is per LINE within the chunk, never around the whole of it, so a
    colour never spans a newline. A chunk is frequently ``"...text\\n"`` and can
    hold several lines; wrapping it whole would leave the reset sitting at the
