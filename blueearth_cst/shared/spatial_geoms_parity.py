"""Relationship contract between our spatial foundation and wflow's staticgeoms.

A built project carries two directories of GeoJSON with SIX COLLIDING
BASENAMES, and the collision is not drift -- it is misidentification. Measured
on ``test_case/test_local`` (2026-08-05, re-measured 2026-08-18), none of the
six pairs holds the same content:

``region``
    ours is the delineated basin; hydromt's is the model GRID EXTENT, a box.
``basins``
    ours is the basin as one polygon; hydromt's is its own per-subbasin
    decomposition. Union areas are identical, feature counts are not.
``rivers``
    different provenance -- ours carries 21 MERIT-derived attributes,
    hydromt's carries routing topology.
``subbasins`` / ``catchments`` / ``locations``
    true copies: identical geometry AND identical schema, ours included.

So ``basins.geojson`` means "the basin" in one tree and "the per-subbasin
polygons" in the other, with nothing on disk saying which is which. A future
rule, the GUI, or a later reader takes the wrong one and is SILENTLY wrong --
the output is plausible, not obviously broken. That is the exposure, and it is
why this module asserts a RELATIONSHIP per layer rather than equality.

**Why not** ``semantic_tree_diff.compare_geojson``. That function is the right
primitive for "did this file change between two trees", and this module reuses
its ideas -- CRS, feature count, non-geometry columns, topological geometry --
but it asserts EQUALITY, which is false for three of the six pairs BY DESIGN.
It also lives in ``dev/scripts/``, which is never part of a run.

**Why a relationship rather than a rerun rule.** Temporal drift is already
structurally impossible: ``data/spatial/`` is upstream of the model build, and
ADR 0004 makes rule 1.09 the terminal writer of the whole model root, so a
partially-failed build cannot leave one tree ahead of the other. What is NOT
guaranteed is that hydromt keeps deriving its ``region`` the way it does today
-- ``GridComponent._region_data`` returns ``box(*self.bounds)``
(``hydromt/model/components/grid.py:269``, hydromt 1.3.1), which is exactly
what makes ``ours <= theirs`` true. A hydromt upgrade that changed that would
break the containment with nothing watching. This module is the watcher.

Board item ``t2608071203`` (R9-1). The authority question -- which tree answers
which question -- is documented in
``dev/reference/contracts/hydrological-model-seam.md``.

Design invariants, mirroring ``interchange_contracts``:

1. Pure functions over PARSED objects (``geopandas.GeoDataFrame``), never
   paths. The caller owns all file I/O, so one function serves a synthetic
   unit test, a real-fixture test, and a future in-pipeline guard with no move.
2. ``-> list[str]`` divergence report; empty list means pass. Every violation
   is surfaced at once.
3. No ``assert`` in validator bodies: ``assert`` is stripped under ``python
   -O``, which would make an optimized in-pipeline guard fail OPEN.

#: through GeoJSON comes back displaced by float formatting. Measured on
#: ``test_case/test_local`` (2026-08-18) the displacement is 4.7e-07 deg for
#: every feature of all three layers -- Polygon and Point alike, which is why
#: this is a distance rather than an area (``locations`` is points, whose
#: symmetric-difference area is 0 however far apart they are).
#:
#: 1e-5 is ~20x the measured noise and ~0.1% of the 0.00833 deg grid cell, so a
#: real divergence -- at minimum one cell -- is caught with three orders of

#: returns False for the polygons here even at 1e-6, because the ring start
#: point moves.
