"""What a climate source ACTUALLY delivers against what the config requested.

``shared.historical_window`` is ONE window for every source. That is right for
the project's own ``shared.clim_historical`` — the forcing the model runs on —
but wrong as a hard demand on the extra ``workflows.analyze_climate.
candidate_sources``, which exist to be COMPARED: CHIRPS begins in 1981, E-OBS
covers Europe only, and a locally staged subset of any of them can start
wherever the staging did. A window one candidate cannot satisfy is not a
misconfigured project; it is the ordinary case of two datasets with different
records.

So the requested window is a CEILING, not a demand. Each source is extracted
over the widest span it actually holds inside that window, and the narrowing is
reported rather than raised (owner ruling 2026-08-16).

Two facts this module keeps apart, because they fail for different reasons:

* **Narrowed** — the delivered span is shorter than the requested one. Always
  reported; never an error.
* **Below the floor** — the delivered span is shorter than
  ``MIN_HISTORICAL_YEARS``. An error for the source that FEEDS THE PIPELINE
  (weathergenr's wavelet decomposition needs that many annual observations),
  reported-only for a source that merely appears in a comparison figure. The
  caller decides which it is via ``enforce_min_years``; nothing here infers it.

Why a module of its own rather than a helper in ``snake_utils``: this needs
pandas, and ``snake_utils`` is imported at Snakefile PARSE time and is
deliberately stdlib+yaml. The floor itself still comes from there, so there is
one definition of it.
