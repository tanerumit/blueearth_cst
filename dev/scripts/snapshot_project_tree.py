"""Snapshot a project tree as a path list and check it holds nothing undeclared.

The check runs against `semantic_tree_diff.build_project_tree_rules`, the
post-migration INVENTORY. (The one-way R9 migration map this tool also drove
was retired 2026-08-11 -- `dev/reviews/2026-08-11_test-suite-bloat-assessment.md`
§6a -- so `--map` now has one choice.)

Wraps steps 0, 3 and 4 of `dev/milestones/r09/observed-tier-runbook.md` in one
command, and derives every map parameter from the config instead of asking for
it on the command line -- the experiment name, the historical store key and the
`clim_project` are all config-determined, and a mistyped `--dataset-key` would
silently turn a mapped store into an unmapped one.

Two uses, and the difference is only whether `--out` is given:

* **Adjudicate before pruning** (runbook step 0) -- no `--out`, nothing is
  written. Every `UNMAPPED` line is then triaged as a leftover orphan or a real
  map gap.
* **Record the observed tier** (runbook steps 3-4) -- with `--out`, the sorted
  path list is written with a provenance header that a reader can regenerate
  from.

`.snakemake/` is excluded: it is Snakemake's bookkeeping, not a project
artifact, and `semantic_tree_diff` excludes it from tree walks for the same
reason. Nothing else is filtered -- an observed snapshot is meant to carry the
undeclared engine artifacts that no `output:` declaration names.

**Reads only.** This script never writes into `project_dir` and never deletes;
pruning is `prune_series_cache.py` and `prune_climate_store.py`, both of which
require an explicit `--delete`.

Usage (from the repo root, inside pixi)::

    # step 0 -- what does the map not cover in the tree as it stands?
    python dev/scripts/snapshot_project_tree.py --config <cfg>

    # steps 3-4 -- record the snapshot and check it
    python dev/scripts/snapshot_project_tree.py --config <cfg> \
        --out <path>/observed_inventory.txt

Exit 0 when every path is classified, 1 when any path is UNMAPPED.

Not part of a run: this inspects a project tree
(see AGENTS.md, "Three homes for executables").
