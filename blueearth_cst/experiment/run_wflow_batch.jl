# P3-3 batching driver (design dev/milestones/p33/performance-passes-design.md §6.1):
# run N Wflow simulations in ONE Julia session, amortizing package-load + JIT.
# Per-TOML try/catch = COMPUTE-level isolation only — a failed member does not
# stop the batch, but Snakemake still fails the job (nonzero exit) and deletes
# the batch's outputs (C5 persistence isolation is DEGRADED by design; blast
# radius = the batch). Per-cst timing/status lines preserve per-run visibility
# now that the Snakemake benchmark row covers the whole batch.
#
# Those lines carry a `[k/N]` POSITION, and are spelled in the toolbox's own row
# format -- `HH:MM:SS - wflow - ...`. Both for the same reason. Rule 3.15 is the
# longest-running step in the toolbox (RLZ_NUM x ST_NUM Wflow runs, batched),
# and Wflow itself is silent on the terminal (`[logging] silent = true`, set so
# Julia's box-drawing records do not swamp the console), so these are the ONLY
# rows a batch emits while it works. Without a position they say a member
# finished but not how much of the batch is left; in a bare format they sit as
# untimestamped text among rows that all carry a clock.
#
# `N` is `length(ARGS)` -- one batch's members, not the experiment's. Rule 3.15
# runs several batches concurrently and each is its own process, so a run-wide
# counter is not knowable here; the rule banner already states the experiment's
# shape, and the batch id is in the log part's name.
using Dates  # stdlib -- resolves via LOAD_PATH's `@stdlib` entry, so it needs no
             # Project.toml dep and adds no Manifest churn (verified under the
             # real `--project=.` invocation rule 3.15 uses)

# Per-member timestep progress, on top of the `[k/N]` position below. The two
# answer different questions -- the counter says how much of the BATCH is left,
# the bar how much of the current MEMBER is -- and a batch member is minutes
# long, so the counter alone leaves the console still for most of a batch.
#
# Included ABOVE `using Wflow` so the FIRST member's bar can open before the
# package load and JIT this process pays once (see `open_frame`); the module
# itself needs only stdlib `Logging`. Members 2..N open theirs inside
# `run_with_progress`.
