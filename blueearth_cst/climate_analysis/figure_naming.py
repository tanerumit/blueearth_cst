"""The WF0 figure filename grammar and its controlled vocabulary.

``dev/reference/wf0-figure-filename-rule.md`` (agreed 2026-08-17) fixes the shape::

    <dataset_scope>_<variable>_<plot_context>_<spatial_scope>.<extension>

with each field drawn from a controlled vocabulary rather than spelled ad hoc at
each call site. This module IS that vocabulary: every WF0 figure name is built
here, so a new context or scope is added in one place and a typo is a raised
error rather than a file nobody finds.

Four fields, and what each answers:

``dataset_scope``
    WHICH dataset — the source id (``era5``, ``chirps``) for a single-source
    figure, :data:`COMPARISON_SCOPE` for one carrying several. Comparison
    figures deliberately do NOT list their datasets in the filename: the legend
    and the run record carry them, so the name stays stable as the compared set
    changes.
``variable``
    The canonical unabridged name — ``precip``, ``temp``, ``pet``. Never
    abbreviated; the rule says so explicitly.
``plot_context``
    The temporal interpretation AND the plot form together, because the two are
    not independent: a monthly climatology drawn as boxes and drawn as lines are
    different figures answering different questions.
``spatial_scope``
    What area the figure reduces to, or frames on.

What is deliberately ABSENT: workflow id, project name, units and analysis
period. Those belong to the run, not to the figure, and putting them in the name
makes every filename churn when a window moves.

**Scope of this grammar, today.** WF0's figures only -- the per-source set
(rule 0.04) and the cross-source comparison (rule 0.05). The wflow FORCING
family (rule 1.12) keeps its ``forcing_<var>_<kind>.png`` names, because the
rule stages WF0 first and extending it is a separate migration with its own
consumers. ``climate_figures`` therefore carries both spellings; see its
``_legacy_figure_name``.
