"""R7-21: the manifest records which branch/commit wrote it.

The baseline fixture (`project_dir`) is **untracked**, so it belongs to no
branch: every branch, worktree and session that runs a workflow writes into the
same tree. `check` therefore answers "does the tree match the manifest" for
whichever branch ran LAST, not for the branch you are on -- a green check can
mean someone else's code is consistent with your manifest.

That is not hypothetical. A `basin_area.png` produced on `feat/outputs-figures`
sat in the shared fixture for days and was read as the pre-R07 baseline
reference; only a byte-size mismatch at the R07 gate forced the question
(dev/followups-archive.md R7-3). These tests pin the stamp that makes such a
misattribution visible instead of silent.
