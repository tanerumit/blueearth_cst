"""The T1+T2 loader composes to today's shape, and refuses what breaks the seam.

Unit surface for ``blueearth_cst/shared/config_composition.py`` (R13 §16.1).
Every case here is one row of the design's gate table, and the module is
deliberately self-contained: it builds its configs in ``tmp_path`` rather than
reading a shipped seed, so it keeps meaning while the seeds migrate in a later
commit and cannot be made green by a config edit.

Three groups carry most of the weight:

* **the composition invariant** — what comes out is what the pre-split config
  held, key for key. `enabled` merged, `config_path` not, an omitted
  `config_path` adding nothing at all;
* **the seam checks** — the four parse-time refusals, including the pair that is
  easy to invert: a broken workflow file *outside* this entry point's scope is
  skipped, and the identical file *inside* it is a hard error. Getting that
  backwards lets a broken WF3 config break a WF1 run, which is the inverse of
  what the milestone is for;
* **the static read scan** (D-9.6), which is checked in both directions and
  against a planted violation, so a green result means the scan looked rather
  than that it could not see.
