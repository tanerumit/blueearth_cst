    * :func:`_relativize_paths` rewrites each declared folder to ``<name>`` in

      being repeated on line after line of a rule's output.

    Together those are the point: a path is stated in FULL once, at the top, and
    referred to by name after that. A token with no header row would be worse
    than the long path it replaced -- an undefined symbol in a log someone reads
    months later -- so nothing tokenizes that is not also declared.

    Empty and ``None`` values are dropped rather than declared, so a workflow
    passes what it has (WF2 has no model) without a caller-side conditional.

    R07 B8. A *suggestion writer*, never a runtime generator: a name derived
    fresh on every run would make each invocation target a new
    ``experiments/<id>/``, so nothing would ever be up to date, incremental
    reruns would be impossible, ``--dry-run`` would mislead, and the baseline
    gate would have no fixed path. The helper is invoked once, deliberately,
    and the value it writes is then read as an ordinary config key.

    The workflow's unset-key default (``allocate.resolve_default_experiment_name``)
    reaches the same name without a config edit, and avoids the trap by
    **reusing** an existing dated experiment instead of minting today's. This
    command remains the way to pin a deliberate name, choose one with
    ``--name``, or start a fresh experiment beside an existing one.

    ``project_dir``'s basename is **slugified**, because it is not guaranteed
    to satisfy the grammar ``validate_experiment_name`` enforces (repo-7):
    ``examples/Gabon`` was live in six shipped configs, and production
    ``project_dir`` values routinely carry uppercase, hyphens or spaces. The
    slug is lowercased, every character outside ``[a-z0-9]`` becomes ``_``,
    runs of ``_`` collapse, leading non-alphanumerics are stripped, and the
    result is truncated to fit the length limit once the date suffix is added.

    This deliberately differs from ``validate_experiment_name``'s
    never-silently-lowercase stance: that function VALIDATES a value a human
    chose, where a silent case change would be a surprise; this one PROPOSES a
    value from a path the user did not write as a slug. The proposal is passed
    back through ``validate_experiment_name`` before being returned, so the two
    can never disagree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    project_dir : str | Path
        the run's output root; only its basename is used
    today : str
        date stamp to append, ``YYYYMMDD``. Passed in rather than read from the
        clock so the helper stays deterministic and testable.

    Returns the validated suggestion, or raises ``ValueError`` if no valid slug
    can be derived (e.g. a basename with no alphanumerics at all).

    The simulation window must sit INSIDE the record, and that is a change from
    how this shipped on 2026-08-10. It was written unconstrained, correctly at
    the time: rule 1.09 declared no climate-store input and read its forcing
    from the data catalog, so the two windows were genuinely independent. Rule
    1.09 now builds the forcing FROM the store, to stop re-reading the same
    source twice, and a simulation period outside the extraction therefore has
    no data behind it. Caught here, at parse time, rather than as a truncated or
    empty forcing twenty rules downstream.

    ``MIN_HISTORICAL_YEARS`` is likewise not applied here. It exists for
    weathergenr's record, so a project can now run a short simulation while
    keeping the >=16-year record a stress test needs — which the single-key
    form could not express.

    OPTIONAL, and absent means EXACT passthrough of ``historical_window`` — not
    a default that happens to coincide. Every config written before this key
    existed therefore behaves identically.

    Returns a mapping with ``starttime``/``endtime``; raises ``ValueError``
    naming the offending key if the window is malformed.
    ``shared_source`` and ``model_source`` name the FILES the two values were
    authored in, and appear in the refusal below. Both default to ``None``, so
    the message shape is unchanged when they are absent -- which is what keeps
    this additive for every caller that has only the two mappings.

    They exist because the comparison became genuinely cross-file at R13: the
    simulation window is authored in the build_model settings file and the
    record in the project file. This is the clearest demonstration that the
    shared-seam placement rule is right rather than arbitrary --
    ``historical_window`` is read by three workflows, so it belongs in the
    project file, and a copy planted in a workflow file is refused at parse
    time rather than allowed to become a second record that disagrees.

def spatial_units_rule(project_dir, spatial_config, data_sources) -> SpatialUnitsRule:
    """Build the one producer contract for the shared vector foundation.

    ONE rule definition, declared in all three workflows (``1.01c`` / ``2.03c``
    / ``3.01f``), over the vector half of what rule 1.01 used to do alone.
    Before ADR 0006 §8, WF2 and WF3 could not reach the basin and subbasin
    boundaries without declaring ``prepare_land_and_soil_maps`` — whose real product
    is ``spatial_maps.nc`` — so a projections-only run would have resampled
    ``vito``, ``modis_lai`` and ``soilgrids`` to draw a subbasin outline.

    Seven outputs. Six are the declared vector artifacts; the seventh,
    ``hydrography.nc``, is the SEAM INTERMEDIATE (§8a). The raster half declares
    it as an input because the whole hydrography grid stack used to cross this
    boundary in memory, and recomputing it would make WF1 read the hydrography
    twice with two grids that can drift. It is deliberately absent from
    ``spatial_catalog.yml``.

    **The params are a pure function of ``project`` + ``shared.basin`` (§8b),
    and that is a requirement, not a convenience.** The five projections-only
    configs contain no ``workflows.build_model`` keys at all, so a params
    payload drawn from that section would differ per invoking workflow — the
    input/params asymmetry ``ext1-02`` forbade for the climate store — and
    ``config_path`` itself differs between a full config and a single-workflow
    one, so declaring it as an input would thrash this rule on every WF1/WF2
    alternation. Hence: no ``config_snake`` input, and the deprecated
    ``workflows.build_model.output_locations`` fallback in
    ``resolve_gauge_points_path`` CANNOT feed this rule. Callers must resolve
    ``spatial_config`` with ``parse_spatial_config(basin_cfg)`` — no model
    section. What makes that safe is rule 3.00b, which already guarantees
    ``shared.basin`` agrees across the workflows that share the rule.

    The thematic source names (``lulc``/``lai``/``soil``) are deliberately NOT
    carried: they belong to the raster half, and carrying them would make a
    change to one of them re-run the vector rule in all three workflows.

def member_pointer_base(config_out_fn) -> tuple[str, str]:
    """Derive one stress-test member's ``run_name`` and output prefix.

    Pure, and it lives here rather than in ``downscale_climate_forcing.py``
    because that module reads the ``snakemake`` global at import time and so
    cannot be imported by a test. Separating it makes the PER-MEMBER KEYING
    testable without a Wflow run.

    Every member-specific pointer the caller writes -- the output CSV, the
    outstate NetCDF, and ``[logging] path_log`` -- is built from these two
    values, so distinct values per member imply distinct pointers per member.
    That is the cheap half of R9 P2's concurrency falsifier. The expensive half
    -- content attribution under a real concurrent batch -- still needs a run,
    because two members could be keyed apart here and still collide if wflow
    ignored the pointer.

    ``out_prefix`` is relative, POSIX and trailing-separated: wflow resolves
    output pointers against ``dirname(toml) + dir_output``, and ``dir_output``
    stays ``"."``, so the config/ -> output/ sibling hop rides in the pointers
    themselves. Keeping the hop out of ``dir_output`` also keeps

    """Wildcard-constraint regex for a padded member index, excluding all-zeros.

    Two jobs, and the second is why this is exact-width rather than the laxer
    ``0*[1-9][0-9]*``:

    1. **Bar the reserved baseline.** ``st_0`` (``st_00`` at width 2) is written
       by ``generate_weather_realizations``; rule 3.11 must never become a
       second producer of it, which surfaces as a ``CyclicGraphException``
       (``generate_scenarios.smk``, rule 3.08's own comment).
    2. **Reject an UNPADDED name outright.** At width 2, ``st_1`` fails to match
       and Snakemake raises ``MissingRuleException`` rather than routing it.
       A lax pattern would accept both spellings, so a producer that forgot to
       pad would silently agree with the DAG — the same invisible
       producer/declaration disagreement that broke this milestone's first two
       rename attempts.

    **ANCHOR-FREE, and that is not a style choice.** The obvious spelling is a
    negative lookahead, ``(?!0+$)[0-9]{width}``. It is WRONG here: Snakemake
    embeds a wildcard's constraint inside the regex for the WHOLE path, so the
    ``$`` anchors to the end of that path rather than to the end of the
    wildcard. With ``.nc`` always following, ``0+$`` can never match, the
    lookahead always succeeds, and the constraint silently degenerates to
    ``[0-9]{width}`` -- which admits the baseline and makes rule 3.11 a second
    producer of it. Caught by ``test_cross_workflow_inputs`` and
    ``test_guard_invalidation`` as a ``CyclicGraphException``, and NOT by a
    plain ``--dry-run``, because whether the ambiguity surfaces depends on the
    DAG shape: where the baseline is also reachable from its own plural rule,
    Snakemake prefers that one (fewer wildcards) and the degeneracy stays
    hidden.

    So the not-all-zeros condition is spelled positionally instead: the index is
    exactly ``width`` digits, of which the first NON-zero one sits at some
    position ``k``. Alternating over ``k`` covers every value except all-zeros,
    with no anchor and no lookahead.

        width 1 -> [1-9]

    Centralizes the "write a figure + log one line" pattern for the plotting
    ``script:`` rules: every produced map/plot is accounted for in the rule's
    log instead of the log being empty or showing only upstream library
    chatter. Parent directories are created. ``kwargs`` pass through to
    ``Figure.savefig`` (e.g. ``dpi``, ``bbox_inches``). matplotlib is
    imported lazily so this module stays light for the Snakefiles that import it
    only for ``get_config`` / ``stress_test_grid``.

    **One row per DIRECTORY, not per figure.** A single wf0 plotting rule
    writes 33 figures, and a row each made the figures the bulk of the whole
    workflow's console -- 54 of wf0's ~117 rows, all of them the same sentence
    with one word changed. The rows are accumulated by directory and emitted on
    flush::

        21:50:31 - plot - 9 figures -> <climate>/era5_20000101_20161231/plots
        21:50:31 - plot - 24 figures -> <climate>/era5_.../plots/subbasins

    The previous scheme printed the directory once and then indented bare file
    names under it, which halved the width but not the row COUNT, and it broke
    down exactly where it was needed most: these rules alternate between a
    parent directory and its ``subbasins`` child, so "state the directory when
    it changes" restated it on nearly every other row. Accumulating per
    directory rather than tracking only the last one is what makes the
    alternation collapse to two rows instead of twelve.

    Naming the directory rather than dropping the paths entirely is the
    deliberate half: a log is the artifact someone sends you when a run went
    wrong, and a bare count would leave "where did they go" answerable only
    from the Snakefile. A per-file record still exists -- on disk, and in the
    rule's declared outputs.

    Flushing is automatic (:func:`flush_figure_bundles`): any other ``log_row``
    closes the open bundles first, so a module's own summary line still reads
    after the figures it summarizes, and ``tee_to_log`` drains whatever is left
    when the log closes.

    ``fig`` defaults to the current figure, which is what every historical
    caller relies on. Pass it explicitly when one plot writes MORE THAN ONE
    file (a vector deliverable plus a raster preview): two saves that both
    resolve "current figure" through global pyplot state are a silent
    correctness trap the moment any intervening code creates a figure.
