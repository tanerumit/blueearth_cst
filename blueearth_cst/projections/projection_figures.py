"""The WF2 projection figure family — one definition of what it contains.

**This module is the single source of the figure set.** Every declaration
downstream is derived from :func:`figure_relative_paths`: the Snakefile's
``WF2_TARGETS``, rule 2.05's ``figure_names`` promise, rule 2.06's outputs, the
``gather_logs`` / ``gather_benchmarks`` edges, the project-tree inventory and
``check_baseline``. That is deliberate — the defect this replaces is eight
figures written where three were declared, so five were invisible to Snakemake:
not cleaned on failure, not remade when deleted, and unusable as a dependency.
A set defined in one place cannot drift from the set that is written.

Why this module exists rather than the arrangement `dc40a22` used
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The reverted integration split the family across the two producers, which left
the page furniture (panel labels, the caveat line, the scenario palette) with no
home either of them could share. Both WF2 producers draw figures from this
family — ``get_change_climate_proj_summary`` draws the change-factor cloud from
the stage-B merge, ``plot_proj_timeseries`` draws the series and monthly
figures — so the family's contract, palette and furniture live here and both
import them. Nothing else changed about the design.

The adopted set (owner ruling, 2026-08-17)
------------------------------------------
Two annual overviews, two views of the change-factor cloud, and one monthly
change-factor figure per configured horizon. The combined cloud is emitted only
when more than one horizon is configured: it exists to answer *how far does the
cloud travel between horizons*, which is not a question a single horizon has.

Layout conventions, all of them owner rulings from 2026-08-11 and toolbox-wide
rather than WF2-specific:

* **No titles anywhere.** Panels carry ``a)`` / ``b)`` labels. What a title used
  to say goes where a journal figure keeps it — the variable and its unit in the
  y-label, and the horizon, reference window and trace counts in the caveat.
* **The WF1 page spec**: ``cartographic_map._publication_rc()`` at
  ``series_figure_size(...)``, ``layout="constrained"``, and the caveat carried
  by ``fig.supxlabel(..., wrap=True)`` — never ``tight_layout`` and never a
  hand-placed ``fig.text``, which does not clip but silently loses its tail.
* **Scenario is the only visual encoding.** No model or member gets its own
  colour, marker or line style, and no legend names one. The cloud annotates
  each point with its model name, which identifies a point without making model
  a visual channel.
