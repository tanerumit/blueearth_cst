# Progress reporting for the two rules that run Wflow.jl (1.14 and 3.15).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Wflow instruments its timestep loop with `@progress`
# (`Wflow.jl`, `run!`), but the only thing that RENDERS those records is the
# `TerminalLogger` its `init_logger` installs -- and we set `[logging] silent =
# true` in the built TOML (74a6e3b) to stop Julia's box-drawing records from
# swamping the console. Under `silent`, `init_logger` swaps that terminal leg
# for a `NullLogger`, and its file leg drops the `:ProgressLogging` group
# outright, so the progress records were destroyed on BOTH legs. The result was
# a multi-minute (on a real basin, multi-hour) rule that emitted nothing at all
# while it worked.
#
# WHY NOT JUST UNSET `silent`. The bar `TerminalLogger` draws is ANSI-driven and
# assumes a TTY. Under Snakemake this stdout is a pipe into the Python tee, so
# that bar arrives as escape noise -- and it is a DIFFERENT bar from the one
# every other long step in the toolbox animates. Unsetting `silent` would also
# bring back the box-drawing flood it was set to remove.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES INSTEAD. Emit a bare machine-readable FRAME carrying the
# fraction, and let the Python side re-render it as the house bar
# (`shared/progress.py`). That is the same split rule 1.08 already uses for
# hydromt's CLI (`DaskFrameRelay`): the child reports a number, the parent owns
# the rendering. It has to be that way round -- the three constraints the bar
# must satisfy (no ANSI, not a TTY at run time, cp1252-safe consoles) are all
# properties of the PARENT's stream, which this process cannot observe.
#
# THE SEAM. `Wflow.run(tomlpath)` installs its own logger via `with_logger`,
# which REPLACES the ambient one rather than composing with it -- so wrapping
# the call from outside cannot see the progress records. `Wflow.run(config)`
# does not install anything (its docstring: "Logging to a file is only part of
# the `run(tomlpath::AbstractString)` method"), so building the config and the
# logger separately is what lets us tee our own leg alongside Wflow's file log.
# `Wflow.Config` and `Wflow.init_logger` are internal API; `Project.toml` pins
# `Wflow = "1"`, and `run_with_progress` degrades to the plain path if either
# is ever withdrawn, so a break costs the bar rather than the run.

    open_frame(label; io = stdout)

Emit the bar's OPENING frame, before anything slow has been reached.

Wflow instruments its timestep loop and nothing else, so two long windows report
nothing at all: Julia's package load and JIT for `using Wflow`, and the
`Wflow.Model(config)` construction inside `Wflow.run` (~45 s on the rapid
fixture, uninstrumented upstream). The Python tee's silence watchdog used to
fill both with a yellow `still running, 0:01:00 elapsed` -- once per WF1 run,
which reads as reasonable, but once per MEMBER in a WF3 batch, times the batches
running concurrently, which does not.

A frame at 0.0 opens the bar before either window, so the console has a line
that is visibly this member's from the start, and the watchdog redraws THAT
rather than printing over it. The cost is that the member's elapsed clock (and
so its early ETA) includes construction, which is honest: that time is part of
the member.

is what lets a driver call it ABOVE its own `using Wflow`.
