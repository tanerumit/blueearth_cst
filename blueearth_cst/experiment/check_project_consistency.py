"""wf3 startup drift guard: experiment config vs project snapshots.

An experiment config is a *full* config (approach A). Its project-level
sections must describe the same project the built model / overlay came from —
otherwise the experiment silently reuses a ``models/hydrology/wflow/`` built
under different settings. This rule (3.00b ``check_project_consistency``) runs
at wf3 rule time and fails loud on divergence, naming the diverging key.

WHICH sections is not written down anywhere: it is derived from the snapshot,
by the rule stated above :func:`guarded_paths`.

Design: dev/milestones/p31/experiment-structure-design.md §3/§3a/§3b/§3d.

The comparator core (``compare_project_consistency``) is a PURE function of the
live config dict + snapshot paths (gate 2 a–h call it directly on staged
config/snapshot pairs with no Snakemake). The ``if "snakemake" in globals()``
harness wires it to the rule; the parse-time digest params (a separate rerun-
trigger layer, gate 2b) live in the Snakefile, not here.

NOTE: no ``from __future__`` import here — Snakemake's ``script:`` runner
prepends a preamble to the script file, so a ``__future__`` import would no
longer be the first statement and raises ``SyntaxError`` at rule time.

# The guard's key list is DERIVED (P2, design D-9.1/D-9.6/D-9.7). There is no
# maintained tuple here, in the Snakefile's `guarded_sections`, or in its
# `guarded_sections_digest` -- the three used to be kept by hand and two of them
# disagreed with this one.
#
# THE RULE: compare every key a project snapshot carries, except two structural
# exceptions. Both are properties of what a snapshot IS, not entries on a list:
#
#  1. `workflows.<name>.enabled` is dropped from both operands. Toggling a
#     workflow off does not change what the model was built from, and an
#     experiment that switches the projections overlay off must not be refused
#     against a model built with it on.
#  2. A stanza the snapshot's own composition never EXPANDED is skipped whole.
#     A snapshot is that workflow's composed config, so a WF1 snapshot carries
#     `workflows.analyze_projections: {enabled: true}` and nothing more -- it
#     never loaded that file. Comparing that against the live config's fully
#     expanded section would refuse every run of every project. This exception
#     is also what keeps `workflows.run_stress_test` out of the WF1 comparison
#     (design D-9.2: `compute:` was never inside this guard, so carving it out
#     here would be a no-op) and what routes `analyze_projections` to the WF2
#     snapshot, which is the document that actually witnessed it.
#
# What the rule CHANGES, deliberately: `climate:` becomes guarded. The climate
# record is what the model was forced with, and editing it after a build is
# unguarded today (design D-9.1 property 2). `schema_version` becomes guarded
# too, as a plain consequence of "every key" -- a snapshot written under a
# different config shape is not a snapshot of this configuration, and the remedy
# the guard already prints (re-run the owning workflow) is the right one.
#
# What it stops REQUIRING: the leaf-by-leaf narrowing to `basin` and
# `model.outvars`. That existed to keep every comparand experiment-invariant
# while `seed` and `julia_threads` sat in the shared section; `C-51` and `C-54`
# removed them, so the exception has lost its cause. D2 is satisfied by removing
# the cause, not by asserting it away -- and `build_experiment_config` emits
# `{experiment_name, run_stress_test}` and nothing else, so no experiment
# overlay can reach a T1 key in the first place.

#: The workflows whose project snapshots the guard reads, in the order it
#: consults them. A path is compared against the FIRST snapshot that witnesses
#: it, so T1 lands on the WF1 snapshot and only what WF1 never expanded falls
#: through to WF2.
GUARD_SNAPSHOT_WORKFLOWS: tuple[str, ...] = ("build_model", "analyze_projections")

#: comparator and the path derivation -- cannot disagree about which key it is.
