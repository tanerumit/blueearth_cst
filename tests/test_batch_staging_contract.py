"""A failed batch's finished members survive Snakemake's real cleanup.

The claim of t2608071217 is about Snakemake, not about the staging module:
when a batch job fails, Snakemake deletes every declared output of that job.
Only a real run shows that staged CSVs are out of its reach and that the retry
runs just the failed member, so this drives a batch-shaped rule -- `update()`
outputs, the same `run_staged_batch` call as rule 4.05 -- with a stub driver
that behaves like `run_wflow_batch.jl` and fails one chosen member.
