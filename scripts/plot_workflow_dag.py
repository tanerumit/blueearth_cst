"""Render a workflow's Snakemake DAG into the PROJECT folder, not the repo root.

The hand-rolled one-liner everyone reaches for::

    snakemake -s build_model.smk --configfile <cfg> --dag | dot -Tpng > dag_model.png

writes ``dag_model.png`` wherever the shell happens to be -- in practice the
repo root -- and names it after nothing in particular. The graph describes ONE
project's run, so it belongs under that config's own ``project_dir``, carrying
the project name and the workflow number:

    <project_dir>/logs/dag/<project_name>_wf<N>_dag.png              (wf1, wf2)
    <project_dir>/logs/dag/<project_name>_wf3_<experiment>_dag.png   (wf3)

**In the project's own ``logs/``, under ``logs/dag/``** (R9 design v10, principles
P4 and P7). R7 put this under ``config/dag/`` on the reasoning that a run is
determined by the config plus the Snakefile, so a rendering of the second
belonged beside the snapshot of the first. R9 overrules that: ``config/`` is the
project's *editable + generated-provenance* root and P4 keeps generated run
records out of it, while P7 places every artifact at the scope of the producer
that wrote it. A DAG render is a generated record OF A RUN, so it goes with the
run's other records.

WF3's render was experiment-scoped (``experiments/<id>/logs/dag/``) until
2026-08-11, when WF3's run records moved up to the project's ``logs/`` and
``benchmarks/`` and the experiment lost those two directories. P7 still holds --
the render still names its producing run -- but the experiment id now rides in
the FILENAME, exactly as it does for the merged log and the benchmark table. It
has to: one project's ``logs/dag/`` holds every experiment's graph, so a name
without the id would have two experiments overwriting one file.

The old rationale's supporting claim still holds and is simply no longer
load-bearing: nothing digests the project's ``config/`` tree by listing it, so
the file never could have churned a fingerprint. It moves because of where it
belongs, not because it was dangerous.

Lives in ``scripts/`` rather than ``dev/scripts/`` because it writes a
user-facing artifact into a production ``project_dir`` from a user's project
config; every ``dev/scripts/`` tool reports on the repository instead
(AGENTS.md, "Three homes for executables").

Usage (inside ``pixi shell``, or via ``pixi run``, from the repo root)::

    python scripts/plot_workflow_dag.py -s build_model.smk --configfile <cfg>
    python scripts/plot_workflow_dag.py -s run_stress_test.smk --configfile <cfg> \\
        --mode rulegraph --format svg

    # anything after `--` is forwarded to snakemake verbatim
    python scripts/plot_workflow_dag.py -s analyze_projections.smk --configfile <cfg> \\
        -- --config foo=bar

Not a Snakemake rule and deliberately so: a rule that renders the DAG would sit
inside the DAG it renders, and would show up in ``--summary`` and in the project
tree gates. It is also not an executing entry point -- ``--dag``/``--rulegraph``
build the graph and run nothing.

The PNG is an UNDECLARED artifact in the project tree (no rule produces it), so
running this against ``test_case/test_local`` adds a file that
``dev/scripts/semantic_tree_diff.py``'s whole-tree comparison will report.
