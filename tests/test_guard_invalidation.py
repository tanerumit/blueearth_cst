"""Gate 2b (i-l) + gate 2c: drift-guard invalidation and fresh-project checks.

Gate 2b is a DAG/rerun-trigger INTEGRATION check, NOT a comparator unit test
(that is ``test_check_project_consistency.py``). It runs the real
``check_project_consistency`` rule through Snakemake against a staged
``project_dir`` and reads Snakemake's scheduling reason from ``--dry-run``
after each comparand mutation, WITHOUT deleting the sentinel between
mutations. Design: dev/p31/experiment-structure-design.md §7 gates 2b/2c, §3c.

Mechanics: "Params have changed since last execution" is reported only when
the rule's outputs EXIST and the recorded params differ — from a cold dir a
dry-run reports "missing output files", which proves nothing about the
rerun-trigger. So the guard rule is executed ONCE for real (cheap: yaml
compare + two tiny text outputs; no data mirror, no Julia) to seed the
``.snakemake`` provenance metadata, then every mutation is checked
edit-then-``--dry-run``. The real execution is never repeated between
mutations — that would move the recorded-params baseline and invalidate the
(l) revert check.
