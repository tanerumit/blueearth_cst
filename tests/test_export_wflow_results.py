"""Unit cases for the wf3 reduction's path derivations (R07 B5/B6) and its
long-format output shape (R11 CR-2).

B5 moved the realization index out of the wflow run CSV's file name and into
its run directory (``hydrology_runs/rlz_<n>/output/cst_<m>.csv``). The older
``output_rlz_<n>_cst_<m>.csv`` name was split on ``_`` at a fixed position --
a derivation that raises ``IndexError`` on the new name, and that is computed
on every row even when ``aggr_rlz=True`` leaves the value unused. That makes it
the one place in the move where a path rename breaks logic rather than a
pointer, so it gets direct coverage. Both of those names carry the pre-R11-P2
``cst_`` member token, deliberately: they name eras, and that is what a tree
from either one actually holds. Everything the current reduction reads or
raises about says ``st_``.

The perturbation-axis collapse that used to be tested here moved to
``tests/test_surface_axes.py`` with the derivation itself: the axis is no longer
a column this writer computes, it is derived at reporting time from
``stress_test_lookup.csv``. Its cases carry a load the rest of the ladder cannot
and are worth finding under their new name -- every tracked config uses a FLAT
monthly perturbation vector, so the baseline manifest and every fixture run are
blind to the collapse by construction, and a seasonal vector is the only input
that can tell reading January apart from taking the annual mean.
