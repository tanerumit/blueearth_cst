def run_and_tee(command, log_path):

    Replaces the ``<cmd> 2>&1 | tee {log}`` idiom in ``shell:`` rules. A bare
    ``| tee`` pipeline returns *tee*'s exit status, not the command's, unless
    bash ``pipefail`` is active -- and Snakemake injects no ``pipefail`` prefix
    on Windows/cmd.exe, so a failed ``hydromt``/``julia`` step is misread as
    success (t260721a; dev/followups.md). Teeing in-process restores exit-code
    fidelity while keeping live console output. The child runs with
    ``shell=False`` so argument quoting is preserved identically across cmd.exe
    and bash (e.g. Julia's ``-e "using Wflow; Wflow.run()"`` stays one argv).

    A *pure* trailing run of benign interpreter-shutdown excepthook noise (see
    ``_EXCEPTHOOK_MARKERS``) is collapsed into a single summary line so it does
    not bury the real end of the log. The collapse is conservative: candidate
    lines are buffered, and any real content flushes them verbatim, so the
    filter only ever fires on a genuinely empty-bodied shutdown cascade.

    Snakemake does not auto-redirect ``script:`` output to the rule's ``log:``

    passes ``snakemake.log[0]``.

    Contract (R3 design §6):
    - creates ``log_path`` and any missing parent directories;
    - both streams are restored in a ``finally`` — the redirection cannot leak
      past the ``with`` block even if the body raises;
    - the exception is **re-raised** (not swallowed), so the traceback still
