Plain-language summary of what we propose to change in WF3, and why. Written to
be read, not parsed — the precise specification, with file and line references,
lives in `wf3-change-requests.md`.

Opened 2026-08-05, and **still being added to**. Nothing here is implemented yet
except **C1**.

Everything is numbered for reference: **C**hanges, **F**indings (problems we
turned up along the way), **O**pen decisions. **Numbers are stable** — once
assigned they are not reused or renumbered, so a later note can point at C14 and
mean the same thing it means today. New items append.

This document covers WF3 as a whole. Part A is the result tables, which is where
the discussion started; further parts are added as topics come up.

# Part A — result tables

## The short version

Today the stress test writes two result tables whose **shape depends on the
basin** — one column per gauge, so a five-gauge basin and a fifty-gauge basin
produce structurally different files. We propose switching to **one table per
variable**, each with the same six columns regardless of how many gauges there
are, with locations as rows instead of columns.

Along the way we settled a naming vocabulary, made explicit which statistics are
pooled across realizations and which are not, and found four numerical problems
that were not visible before.

---

## What is wrong with the tables today

- **The header grows with the basin.** Each gauge is its own column, so no two
  projects produce the same file structure and any script that reads them has to
  discover the columns first.
- **Two names for the same thing.** The perturbation columns were called `tavg`
  and `prcp`, while everywhere else in the toolbox the same two quantities are
  `temp` and `precip`.
- **All-or-nothing pooling.** A single switch decided whether *every* statistic
  was averaged over realizations or *none* was. There was no way to say "pool the
  return periods, because a single realization is too short to estimate a 10-year
  flood, but keep everything else per realization" — which is what you actually
  want.
- **The return period is invisible.** The table records a flood level but not
  whether it is a 10-year or a 20-year one. Two runs with different settings
  produce files that look identical and mean different things.
- **Inconsistent metric names,** one of them misspelled (`returninternval`) and
  shipped to users.

---

## What the tables will look like

One file per variable, named after the variable:

    q_indicators.csv
    aet_indicators.csv
    recharge_indicators.csv
    overland_flow_indicators.csv
    snow_indicators.csv
    precip_indicators.csv

Only the variables actually requested in the model configuration get a file.
Every file has the same seven columns:

| column | what it holds |
|---|---|
| `metric` | what was calculated, e.g. `q_mean_annual_7day_min` |
| `st_id` | which stress-test design point — the key into the design table (C23) |
| `temp_change` | the temperature perturbation, in °C |
| `precip_change` | the precipitation perturbation, in % |
| `realization_id` | which realization — or `0`, meaning "pooled over all of them" |
| `location` | the gauge or subbasin number |
| `value` | the number |

`temp_change` and `precip_change` are a **deliberate duplicate** of what the
design table already holds — kept so the file can be plotted without a join. See
C28, which is why they are here and what has to happen when a third stress
dimension arrives.

---

## Naming

**C1 — Rename the perturbation columns to `temp_change` and `precip_change`.**
*(Already done.)* They were `tavg` and `prcp`, the only place in the whole
repository using different names for temperature and precipitation. Not renamed
to bare `temp`/`precip` because these columns hold the *perturbation applied*,
not the temperature or rainfall itself — and the two axes are not even the same
kind of number (°C added, versus % change). A column called `temp` in a results
table would read as a temperature.

**C2 — Put the variable into the metric name.** `q_mean_annual_max`, not `max`.
This makes each row self-explanatory when a file is opened on its own or emailed
to someone, which is worth the small redundancy with the filename.

**C3 — Spell out the statistic names instead of borrowing the conventional
abbreviations.** No `Q95`, no `Q10`, even though they are standard. The reason is
specific: what this tool computes as "q95" is the mean annual **95th
percentile**, a high flow — whereas `Q95` in hydrology conventionally means the
flow *exceeded* 95% of the time, which is a low-flow drought index. They are
opposite ends of the distribution, so borrowing the abbreviation would mislead
exactly the reader who knows what it usually means. We write
`q_mean_annual_p95`.

**C4 — Say "mean annual" where that is what it is.** Almost every statistic here
is "compute it for each year, then average across years", and the old names hid
that. `Q7day_max` becomes `q_mean_annual_7day_max`, which is what it has always
been. This also retires the shipped misspelling.

**C5 — Put the return period into the metric name.** `q_return_level_10yr_max`.
Costs nothing and stops the file being ambiguous about which return period it
holds.

## Shape

**C6 — Locations become rows, not columns.** This is the main change. The file
structure stops depending on the basin.

**C7 — One file per variable.** Discharge, evapotranspiration, recharge and so on
each get their own table. This removes the need for a "which variable is this"
column and lets each variable use the metric names and units that suit it.

**C8 — Keep a `location` column even where there is only one value today.** It
costs one column, means the tables can be stacked together without editing, and
is where subbasin identifiers will go under C20.

## Realizations

**C9 — Retire the pool-everything switch.** In the new shape, "pooled" is no
longer a different file layout — it is just extra rows — so the switch has
nothing left to switch.

**C10 — Give each statistic the pooling that suits it,** in three groups:

- *Per realization:* mean, max, min, 95th percentile, 7-day maximum and minimum,
  baseflow index. These are all "yearly value, then average over years", and
  because realizations are the same length, averaging the per-realization numbers
  gives exactly the pooled number back. Nothing is lost by reporting them
  separately, and you gain the spread.
- *Pooled only:* the two return-period statistics. Fitting a 10-year flood to one
  short realization is unreliable; pooling multiplies the sample by the number of
  realizations. Reporting a per-realization version alongside would just invite
  someone to use it.
- *Special case:* the wettest-month and driest-month statistics, which have to
  choose a month before they can average anything — see C12.

**C11 — `realization_id = 0` means pooled.** A number rather than a word keeps
the column numeric. It is safe only because, under C10, no statistic ever appears
in both forms — if that ever changes, this has to become a word, and that
condition is written down in the specification.

## Seasonal statistics

**C12 — Choose the wettest and driest month once, from the unperturbed baseline,
and use it everywhere.** Otherwise each stress-test member could pick a different
month and the response surface would be comparing January against July without
saying so. If the *shift* in wettest month is itself interesting, that is a
different indicator and can be added later.

**C13 — Include the unperturbed baseline run in the results table.** It currently
does not appear when realizations are pooled, so the response surface has no
origin point — and C12 cannot pick a month from a record that is not there.

## Numbers

**C14 — Store values at single precision and do not round them.** The original
request was to round everything to two decimals, but that would have destroyed
the low-flow half of the results: a 7-day minimum flow of `0.0034` becomes
`0.00`. Single precision gives short, readable numbers *and* keeps small values,
so no rounding rule is needed at all.

**C15 — Keep the model's own units.** Where a unit conversion is needed it is
done properly or not at all. Concretely this fixes F2: overland flow is
summarised as a yearly average flow rate rather than added up, while
evapotranspiration and recharge keep their yearly totals, because adding up a
daily depth is a legitimate total and adding up a flow rate is not.

**C16 — Pool the yearly extremes, not the stitched-together record.** Compute
each realization's yearly maxima and minima within that realization, then combine
those before fitting the return period. This fixes F3 and is simpler than what it
replaces — the artificial calendar disappears entirely.

## Locations

**C17 — Use the plain gauge number** (`130000086`), not `Q_130000086`. The `Q_`
was only ever there because it was a column header.

**C18 — Give the basin-averaged variables the same location numbers as
discharge.** This needs no translation work: the model already labels its gauges
with the subbasin identifier, so discharge at a gauge and evapotranspiration over
that gauge's catchment already share a key. It means a gauge's flow statistics and
its catchment's water balance can sit side by side.

**C19 — Produce the overall basin figure directly, not by averaging the
per-location ones.** Whether that averaging would even be valid depends on O1, and
producing the basin figure directly is both safer and already possible.

**C20 — Report precipitation as a subbasin mean rather than at gauge points.**
More useful for this tool than rainfall at an exact point, and it also stops F4.
Basin-wide averaging needs only a configuration change; per-subbasin averaging
needs a small change to how the model is set up.

## Checks

**C21 — Move the reference check for these tables to a tolerance comparison**
instead of an exact match. Without rounding (C14), an exact match would fail on
numerically meaningless differences. The comparison this needs already exists and
is used for the discharge reference.

# Part B — how stress-test runs are identified

## The short version

Every run is currently identified by its filename — `rlz_2_cst_37` — and what
`cst_37` actually *is* exists nowhere except inside `cst_37.csv`, as twelve
monthly rows. We propose writing a **master design table**: one row per
stress-test point, listing what climate perturbation it applies. Runs keep a
readable two-part identity, but the meaning finally lives somewhere you can look
it up.

We also rename the stress-test token from `cst_` to `st_`.

## Why this matters more than it looks

Part A's main achievement was making the results table shape independent of the
basin. But under **multi-dimensional** stress testing, the current design breaks
that from the other end: `temp_change` and `precip_change` are columns, so adding
a seasonality or spell-length dimension adds a column, and the header depends on
the configuration again.

A design table with an id fixes that permanently — the results tables reference a
point instead of describing it, and their shape stops depending on how many
stress dimensions there are. That is the real argument for this change, and it is
why it belongs alongside Part A rather than after it.

## The changes

**C22 — Rename the stress-test token from `cst_` to `st_`.** `cst` is the name of
the whole tool, so using it for one member of a grid inside that tool says
nothing. More to the point, **the code already says `st`** — the workflow
wildcard is `st_num`, the count is `ST_NUM`, the helper is `stress_test_grid()`,
the configuration section is `stress_test:`. Only the *files* say `cst_`. The
Snakefile even builds a filename called `cst_...` out of a wildcard called
`st_num`. So this removes an inconsistency that already exists rather than
introducing churn. `rlz_` stays as it is: unlike `cst`, it is a terse
abbreviation of a *correct* term — realization is the standard word for a
stochastic replicate, and there is no collision to fix.

**C23 — Write a stress-test design table.** One row per design point, listing the
perturbation it applies, with a row for the unperturbed baseline where every
change is zero. This is the artifact that is missing today: a single place that
answers "what was run 37?". It also becomes the natural place to add a dimension
— a new column, rather than a new naming convention.

The extra dimensions are not hypothetical. **F14** records that the installed
generator already accepts wet/dry day frequency, extreme intensification, and
spell-length factors, all left at their defaults and unreachable from any project
configuration. Adding them is plumbing, not new science — which is exactly the
case this design table was proposed for, and the reason it is worth doing before
they arrive rather than after.

**C24 — Keep two identifiers, not one.** The design point and the realization are
different kinds of thing and should not collapse into a single counter:

- the **design point** is *designed* — enumerable, meaningful, worth looking up;
- the **realization** is *sampled* — realization 7 has no parameters, it is
  simply draw 7, and there is nothing to look up.

Four practical consequences of keeping them apart. The return-period statistics
pool over realizations but *not* over design points (C10), which a single
identifier cannot express. Adding realizations would otherwise renumber the whole
design. The workflow engine can still select "everything for realization 2" as a
pattern, which the batching work depends on. And when a run fails, the log name
tells you what broke instead of sending you to a lookup table.

**C25 — Design-point numbers are meaningful within one experiment, not across
experiments.** A sequential number over an enumerated grid changes meaning the
moment the grid changes — add one temperature step and everything after it
shifts. Rather than pretend otherwise, the design table lives in the experiment
folder next to the configuration snapshot that produced it, which is already the
place where settings are pinned. A different configuration is a different
experiment, which is how the tool already works.

*Considered and rejected:* numbering derived from the parameter values
themselves, which would be stable across grid changes but unreadable and
unsortable; and numbering that encodes the grid position, which is
self-describing but grows a segment for every dimension added — the thing this
change exists to avoid.

**C26 — The list of design points is worked out once and used twice.** The same
routine that tells the workflow engine which runs to plan also writes the design
table, so the two cannot disagree. Without this there is a circularity — the
engine needs to know the runs before any of them has produced a file.

**C27 — The number width follows the count rather than being fixed.** Three
digits caps at 999, and ten realizations across a 5 × 5 × 3 grid is already 750
before a fourth dimension is added.

**C28 — The results tables carry `st_id` *alongside* `temp_change` and
`precip_change`, not instead of them.** Decided 2026-08-05, **for this stage**.

The alternative was to drop the two perturbation columns and let `st_id` be the
only link to what a run was. That would have kept the results shape fixed at any
number of stress dimensions — the property Part A exists for — at the cost of
needing a join before anything can be plotted. Keeping both means the files stay
readable on their own, which is what has driven most of the Part A decisions.

**What this costs, stated plainly.** The two columns are now a *cached copy* of
what the design table holds, so they can disagree with it if anything goes wrong
in writing them, and the results shape is again tied to the number of stress
dimensions — adding a third adds a column. That is acceptable while stress
testing is two-dimensional. It stops being acceptable the moment it is not, which
is the whole reason Part B exists.

**So the decision carries a trigger rather than a hope.** Two things follow:

- the writer must check, for every row, that `temp_change` and `precip_change`
  match the design table's entry for that `st_id` — a cached copy that nothing
  verifies is a copy that eventually lies;
- when the stress-test configuration gains a **third dimension**, the results
  writer should stop and say so, naming this decision, rather than quietly adding
  a column. At that point the choice is made again with the extra dimension
  actually in hand.

# Part C — generator plumbing

**C29 — Retire the per-run weather-generator configuration file.** **Done
2026-08-05**, together with **F6** (only the two switches moved across, not the
perturbation settings that were never read) and **F7** (the template is now
declared, so editing it forces a rerun). The output filename reaches the R script
as an argument and is split there, which means the planned member-token rename
(C22) will not touch it. Not yet exercised end to end — nothing in the test suite
runs the R script, so this first executes in a real run.

Every perturbed run currently gets its own small configuration file,
`weathergen_config_rlz_<m>_cst_<n>.yml`, written by its own workflow step with
its own log and timing record. On a ten-realization, eighty-eight-point sweep
that is 880 configuration files, 880 logs and 880 timing files.

They contain almost nothing. The only thing that varies between them is **the
name of the file the run should write** — split into a prefix and a suffix
because the generator's write routine takes them separately. Everything else is
identical in all 880: two on/off switches, and a copy of the perturbation
settings that the generator does not read (see F6).

The workflow engine already knows the output filename — it is the step's own
declared output. So the filename can be passed straight to the R script as an
argument, the two switches belong in the single shared generator configuration
that already exists, and the whole per-run step disappears.

**C34 — Decide every weather-generator argument deliberately, instead of
inheriting defaults by omission.** *(Proposed 2026-08-05, not yet ruled.)*

We call two generator routines. Between them they accept forty-nine arguments,
and we set thirty — the other nineteen take whatever the package decides. None of
what we pass is out of date (see F13), but the gap is where the interesting
material sits: three of the unset arguments are **additional ways to stress the
climate** (F14), one is a reproducibility control we set on one call and not the
other (F15), and one silently picks an evaporation method that a later step
overrides anyway (F16).

The proposal is not "expose everything" — most defaults are fine and exposing
them would bloat the configuration for no gain. It is that each argument gets one
recorded decision: surface it, or accept the default *on purpose*. An argument
nobody has looked at is not the same as an argument someone chose.

---

# Part D — where settings live — **DEFERRED**

**Deferred 2026-08-05 to its own milestone.** Everything below stands as written;
it simply is not part of the batch being built now. It is the only part with a
breaking change for existing projects, it touches every project's configuration
file, nothing is currently broken by leaving it alone, and it is not what this
work set out to fix.

One thing must not be lost with it: **F7** was going to be solved for free by
C31, since removing the template removes the thing nobody declared. Deferred, it
needs its own one-line fix instead, or it quietly stays open.

## The short version

There are three places a setting can live, and which one it lives in was decided
by which file existed when the setting was added. The intention was that rarely
changed tuning would sit apart from project settings, keeping the project file
light. That intention is sound, but "rarely changed" turned out not to be a rule
anyone can apply — so parameters ended up on both sides more or less at random,
including two that are duplicated and two that are read by nothing.

We propose splitting by **who owns the value** instead, which is decidable.

## The three surfaces today

| file | what it is | validated? |
|---|---|---|
| `config/workflows/snake_config_*.yml` | the project's own settings, one per project | by each workflow as it reads |
| `config/advanced_settings.yml` | toolbox-wide settings applying to every project | **yes** — closed schema, unknown keys rejected at load, plus tests |
| `config/templates/weathergen_config.yml` | headed "Weather Generator Advanced settings" | **no** |

The second and third have the same stated purpose. Only one of them is built for
it — and it is not the one holding the generator settings.

## The changes

**C30 — Split settings by who owns the value, not by how often they change.**

- **The project file** holds anything describing *this* basin or experiment: what
  is perturbed, over what period, how many realizations, the random seed.
- **The toolbox settings file** holds values that apply to *every* project, under
  its existing three-way split — hard limits, overridable defaults, and external
  version pins.
- **The templates folder** holds the *shape* of files the workflow generates. It
  is not a settings surface, and using it as one is what created this problem.

"Rarely changed" cannot be applied consistently, because every setting is rarely
changed until someone needs to change it. Ownership can.

**C31 — Redistribute the weather-generator settings accordingly**, after which the
template no longer exists as a settings file:

| setting | goes to | because |
|---|---|---|
| `dry.spell.change`, `wet.spell.change` | project file, with the other perturbations | they *are* perturbations — see F8 |
| `month.start` | project file, merged with the existing hydrological-year setting | see F9 |
| `seed` | project file | reproducibility is a property of an experiment |
| `warm.*`, `knn.*`, `mc.*` | toolbox settings, as overridable defaults | genuine generator tuning |
| `compute.parallel` | toolbox settings, beside the other parallelism setting | a resource choice, not a science one |
| `evaluate.model`, `evaluate.grid.num` | deleted | read by nothing — see F10 |
| `output.path`, `sim.year.*`, `nc.file.*` | nowhere | never settings; the workflow computes them per run |

This also disposes of **F7** at no extra cost: with no template to read, there is
no undeclared input to declare.

**C32 — Write the resolved toolbox settings into the project under their own
name.** They are already recorded — embedded inside a larger file, under a key,
in a directory named after a checksum. That is correct and unfindable: the tool's
own author looked for them and concluded they were not saved at all. Writing them
as a plainly named file beside the project-configuration snapshot costs nothing
and answers "what settings produced this run?" without needing to know where to
look. The *resolved* values, not a copy of the source file, since resolved is
what actually applied.

**C33 — Group the toolbox settings by kind first, component second.** The three
existing sections encode whether a project may override a value, which is the
first thing a reader needs to know; grouping by component would bury it. But once
the generator settings arrive the file is mostly generator settings, so grouping
within each section is worth having:

    defaults:
      weathergen:  ...
      wflow:       ...

The case that settles the order: the minimum-historical-record limit *originates*
with the weather generator — it is what the wavelet analysis needs — but it is
*enforced* against the model build and against the shared climate store, so it
binds all three workflows. Filing it under the generator would misdescribe where
it actually applies. It stays a limit, with its origin explained in its comment.

**One gap this opens.** The generator tuning settings are neither hard limits nor
version pins, which leaves them as overridable defaults — and that means defining
a project-level key that can override each one. That is the same arrangement the
existing thread-count setting already uses, and an override key that nobody uses
costs nothing. The alternative, a fourth category for "adjustable by a maintainer
but not by a project", adds a concept to a file whose three-way split is
deliberate, and blocks a project that has a genuine reason to differ.

## What existing projects have to do

Almost nothing, by design — with one exception.

- **New perturbation and seed settings are optional**, defaulting to today's
  values, so an untouched project file keeps working and produces identical
  results.
- **Generator tuning moves without touching project files at all** — it goes from
  one toolbox file to another.
- **The hydrological-year setting is the one breaking change.** It currently
  exists twice (F9) and has to become one setting in one place. A project file
  that still declares it in the old location should be **refused with an
  explanation**, not silently ignored — the same treatment proposed for the
  retired pooling switch (O2). Silently ignoring it would change results while
  the file still says otherwise.

# Part E — how the hydrological runs are batched

## The short version

Several stress-test runs share one Julia session, so the startup cost is paid
once instead of once per run. On the tiny test basin that is worth 35% of the
whole workflow. On a real basin it is worth about 2%, and the setting that
controls it is currently chosen in a way that makes it *larger* on exactly the
runs where it helps least — while multiplying what is lost when one run fails.

**C35 — Batch one run per session by default; make batching something you turn
on.** *(Proposed 2026-08-06, not yet ruled.)*

## Why the measured win does not survive the move to a real basin

What sharing a session saves is a **fixed** amount: starting Julia and warming up
the model code, measured at roughly **81 seconds** per run saved. That is
compilation, not simulation — it does not grow when the basin does.

| a single run takes | saved by sharing a session |
|---|---|
| 35 seconds (the test basin) | **70%** |
| 1 hour | **2.2%** |
| 6 hours | **0.4%** |

The 35% headline from the batching milestone is real and was carefully measured —
on a basin where a run costs about as much as the startup it amortizes. At an
hour a run, the saving is rounding error.

## The setting scales the wrong way

The default batch size is chosen from **how many runs there are**, capped at
eight. A realistic sweep — 5 realizations × 25 perturbations = 125 runs — hits
that cap, so it gets the **largest** batch allowed:

| | |
|---|---|
| whole sweep, one run per session | ~42.6 hours |
| whole sweep, eight per session | ~41.8 hours |
| **gained** | **~1.9%** |
| **lost when one run fails** | up to **seven completed runs** — 7 hours at an hour each, **42 hours** at six |

The workflow already documents this default as "backwards" — but only for **disk**,
since holding eight runs' intermediate files at once grows the footprint as the
sweep grows. The timing argument is backwards in exactly the same way and for the
same reason: **batch size is decided by sweep size when the only thing that
should decide it is how long one run takes.**

## Three things that also get worse at scale

- **Scheduling.** 125 separate jobs spread across cores far better than 16 batch
  jobs. One slow batch holds up the whole stage — and the batching work chose a
  longest-job-first scheduler precisely because run times vary.
- **Restarting.** A crash, an out-of-memory, a timeout: one run lost with
  batching off, up to eight with it on. Over a forty-hour sweep that stops being
  hypothetical.
- **Seeing where you are.** At six hours a run, per-run jobs are how progress is
  visible at all. Batching moves that into log lines inside a driver.

## What the change is

Default to one run per session. Keep batching available as a setting, and switch
it on in the test configuration so the fast-sweep behaviour and the batched code
path both stay exercised. **Nothing about the mechanism changes** — only which
side of it is the default.

It also dissolves an open problem rather than solving it: the disk followup asks
for a cap computed from available headroom and an estimate of each run's
intermediate size, and the hard part is that those files do not exist yet when
the cap has to be chosen. With one run per session the term that needed capping
is gone.

**In the meantime**, any production configuration should set the batch size to 1
explicitly. That is a one-line change and needs no code.

# Findings, open items and cost

These span the whole document, not just Part A.

## Findings

None of these were the point of the exercise; all were found by reading the code
the changes touch. None are fixed yet.

**F1 — The perturbation columns hold January, not the year.** The stress-test
files contain twelve monthly values, and the results table reads only the first
and labels it as the member's perturbation. This has never been visibly wrong
because the shipped settings use the same value for all twelve months — but a
project using a seasonal perturbation would get a response surface secretly
indexed by its January figure. **Not addressed by any change here:** deciding what
twelve months should collapse to (a mean? an annual total?) is a method question,
so it is recorded rather than patched.

**F2 — Overland flow is added up in the wrong units.** Evapotranspiration and
recharge are produced as millimetres per day, so adding up a year of them
correctly gives millimetres per year. Overland flow is produced as cubic metres
per *second*, and adding those up gives a quantity that is not millimetres, not
cubic metres, and not anything — off by a factor of 86400. Any project asking for
overland flow currently gets a wrong column under a wrong stated unit.
**Addressed by C15.**

**F3 — The 7-day averaging window runs across the join between realizations.**
When realizations are pooled they are currently stapled end to end into one
artificial record. A 7-day average then spans the seam and can manufacture a low
flow that occurred in none of the realizations — which becomes that year's
minimum and feeds the low-flow return period. It matters most in basins whose dry
season falls near the turn of the year. **Addressed by C16.**

**F4 — Rainfall at gauges is calculated and then thrown away.** The model is
already set up to report it at gauge locations, and the results step silently
discards those columns. **Addressed by C20.**

**F5 — Run numbers silently change meaning when the configuration changes.**
`cst_37` is the thirty-seventh point of an enumerated grid, so adding a single
temperature step shifts everything after the first block — the same filename then
refers to a different climate. This is true today and always has been; nothing
warns about it, and results carried between runs can be compared under the
assumption that the numbers mean the same thing. It becomes more frequent once
stress testing is multi-dimensional. **Addressed by C25**, which scopes the
numbering to one experiment and writes down what each number meant.

**F6 — The per-run generator configuration carries no per-run information, and
the part of it that looks informative is ignored.** Each
`weathergen_config_rlz_<m>_cst_<n>.yml` copies in the full temperature and
precipitation perturbation settings from the project configuration — the step
counts and the monthly minimum and maximum ranges. The R script reads **only the
two transient on/off switches** from those blocks. The numbers that actually
perturb the run come from `cst_<n>.csv`, not from here.

So anyone opening one of these files to find out what a run did would read
plausible-looking perturbation ranges that had no part in it. The rest of the
file is a filename. **Addressed by C29.**

**F7 — Editing the weather-generator template changes nothing until something
else forces a rerun.** Step 3.04 reads `config/templates/weathergen_config.yml`
to seed the generator settings, but does not declare it as an input. That
template is a tracked, editable file carrying the variable list, the sampling
size and the wavelet variable — all of which change what the generator produces.

Change it and the workflow sees no reason to act: 3.04 stays satisfied, the
configuration it wrote earlier stays in place, and 3.06 keeps generating
realizations from the old settings. Nothing looks wrong downstream, because the
*generated* configuration is properly declared, so the stale settings propagate
looking entirely consistent.

Worth distinguishing from the neighbouring case: the project configuration is
deliberately held outside the change-detection in these steps, and for a good
reason — pinning an experiment name rewrites that file, and a naive dependency
would invalidate the entire pipeline every time someone did so. The template has
no such reasoning behind it. It is simply not listed. **Addressed by C31**, which removes the template
as a settings surface — with nothing to read, there is nothing to declare. If
C31 is not taken, the fix is a one-line declaration on step 3.04.

**F8 — Two stress-test dimensions are sitting in the "advanced" file.**
`dry.spell.change` and `wet.spell.change` are twelve monthly coefficients each,
adjusting dry- and wet-spell length, and they are handed to the perturbation
routine alongside the temperature and precipitation factors. They are
perturbations in every sense — and they are precisely the third and fourth stress
dimensions Part B was designed to accommodate. Today they are pinned at "no
change" in a file no project config can reach. **Addressed by C31.**

**F9 — The start of the hydrological year is configured twice, differently.** The
projections workflow reads it from the project file as a month *name*; the
weather generator reads it from the template as an *integer*. Same concept, two
files, two spellings, two encodings, and no link between them — set one and the
other does not follow. **Addressed by C31**, with a caveat: the two consumers use
it differently (one as an aggregation boundary, one as a simulation start), so
merging them should be checked against both before it is done, not assumed.

**F10 — Two generator settings are read by nothing.** `evaluate.model` and
`evaluate.grid.num` appear in the template with explanatory comments and are
touched by neither R script. They describe a capability the pipeline does not
use. **Addressed by C31.**

**F11 — The contract check for the generator configuration covers eleven of the
sixteen settings the generator actually reads.** Five are unchecked:
`warm.signif.level`, `warm.sample.num`, `mc.wet.quantile`, `mc.extreme.quantile`
and `compute.parallel`. If one went missing the check would still pass and the R
would hand an empty value to the generator. The check's own description claims it
is "the key set the R side reads". **Not addressed by any change here** — it
should be widened to sixteen whenever C31 lands, since C31 changes where those
settings come from.

**F12 — The generated-series start year is hardcoded.** The length of the
synthetic record is computed as reaching from 2010 to the run window, plus a
two-year pad, with 2010 written into the Python as "the end of the historical
period". Nothing checks that against the historical record the project actually
has. A basin whose record ends in 2005, or extends to 2020, gets an anchor that
is simply wrong, and nothing says so. **Not addressed by any change here** — the
fix is to derive it from the climate store rather than assume it, which changes
numbers and so needs its own decision.

**F13 — Nothing we pass to the weather generator is out of date; the dead
settings are leftovers from an older version of it.** Checked against the pinned
generator version actually installed. Every argument both scripts pass still
exists. The two settings that are read by nothing (F10) are survivors from a time
when evaluation was part of the generation routine — it has since been split into
routines of its own, and whether diagnostic plots are produced is now controlled
by a different argument that we never set, so it is always on. Someone switching
the old setting off today would reasonably expect the plots to stop. They do not.

**F14 — The generator already supports three more ways to stress the climate than
the toolbox can reach.** Beyond shifting temperature and rescaling precipitation
mean and variance, the installed version accepts a **wet/dry day frequency**
factor, an **extreme-intensification** control with its own threshold and
strength, and the **spell-length** factors from F8. All are left at their
defaults, unreachable from any project configuration.

This matters for Part B specifically. The design table was proposed to make
multi-dimensional stress testing durable, and the obvious question was what the
extra dimensions would be. They already exist — the capability is installed and
working, and only the plumbing is missing.

**F15 — The perturbation step is not seeded, though the generation step is.** The
project configuration supplies a random seed to the routine that generates the
baseline realizations. The routine that then perturbs them accepts a seed too,
and is given none. Whatever is random in that step is therefore not reproducible,
while the step before it is — an asymmetry nobody chose. Whether it actually
matters depends on what the perturbation does stochastically, which should be
confirmed rather than assumed; the asymmetry is real either way.

**F17 — One gauge is reported twice, and nothing notices.** Discharge is asked
for at two sets of locations: the basin outlets, and the registered measurement
stations. When a basin outlet *is* one of the registered stations — the normal
case — the model writes that location's flow **twice**, under the same name. The
results table then reports six gauges where there are five, and a reader has no
way to tell that two of the columns are one place.

Found 2026-08-05 in the test fixture, in the error message from a different
failure. The two series there are **byte-for-byte identical**, so nothing is
numerically wrong today, and any per-location total simply counts that station
twice.

**But the harmless version is not guaranteed.** The two copies agree because both
map entries happen to resolve to the same grid cell. Nothing asserts that. If an
outlet identifier and a station identifier ever coincide *numerically* while
pointing at different places, the same duplication would put two genuinely
different flow series under one name — and the existing cross-file check would
still pass, because it compares the two files' column lists against each other
and both carry the duplicate identically.

**Addressed by C17's uniqueness check** on the row key, which is the reason that
check was proposed. It also confirms **F4** with data rather than inference: the
discarded rainfall-at-gauges columns are right there in the same output.

**F18 — The batch-size default is chosen from the wrong quantity, and the tiny
test basin hides it.** It is computed from how many runs the sweep contains,
capped at eight — so the bigger the sweep, the bigger the batch, and a realistic
125-run sweep gets the maximum. What batching actually saves is a fixed ~81
seconds per run, so the correct input is **how long one run takes**, which the
formula never consults.

On the test basin the two happen to agree, which is why this was invisible: a
12-run sweep yields a batch of 4, every measurement in the batching milestone
stands, and the win is a genuine 35%. The disagreement only appears above 24 runs
— and it appears hardest on the runs where the benefit has already vanished.

Noted 2026-08-06 from the owner's statement of real-world scale: 1–6 hours per
run, 3–5 realizations × 25 perturbations. **Addressed by C35.**

**F16 — Potential evaporation is computed twice, by two different methods.** The
generator computes it while applying the perturbation, using its own default
method, and then the downscaling step recomputes it from the perturbed
temperature using a different one. So the chain contains two methods, neither
chosen at the first step, and the first result is very probably thrown away.
Confirm it is discarded before removing the work — but at minimum the method
should be chosen rather than defaulted.

---

## Open decisions

**O1 — Do the subbasins overlap?** If each gauge's area is its full upstream
catchment, they nest inside one another; if each is only its own local area, they
tile. This decides whether an overall basin figure could be averaged from them —
though C19 recommends not doing that regardless.

**O2 — What should happen to an old configuration file** that still contains the
retired pooling switch (C9). It would currently be ignored in silence, leaving
the user believing it still does something. The recommendation is to refuse to
run and say so.

**O3 — CLOSED 2026-08-05 → see C28.** Ruled *alongside*: the results tables carry
`st_id` **and** the perturbation columns, for this stage. The recommendation had
been *replace*, for a permanently fixed shape; the owner chose readability now
with an explicit revisit when a third dimension arrives. C28 records the cost and
the trigger.

---

## What this costs

- **The stress-test workflow has to be re-run once** on the test project, and the
  reference fingerprints re-recorded. C1 is already waiting on that same run, so
  it should be done once at the end, not per change.
- **A written record of the old and new names** is required by the repository's
  own conventions, covering both the column renames and the removal of the
  pooling switch (C9).
- **The results workflow starts depending on the model configuration** to know
  which variable files to produce (C7). It currently discovers this while
  running, which is too late for the workflow engine to plan the job.

**What each step actually waits for.** The diagram's layout can suggest
dependencies that are not there, so the declared inputs, in full:

| step | waits for | feeds |
|---|---|---|
| 3.03 `climate_stress_parameters` | the project config, consistency check | 3.07, 3.11 |
| 3.04 `prepare_weagen_config` | consistency check **only** | 3.06 |
| 3.05 `prepare_weagen_config_st` | consistency check **only** | 3.07 |
| 3.06 `generate_weather_realization` | the historical climate file **and 3.04's config** | 3.07, 3.08 |
| 3.07 `generate_climate_stress_test` | 3.06's baseline realization, 3.03's perturbation file, 3.05's per-run config | 3.08 |

So 3.03, 3.04 and 3.05 are three **independent** starting points, not a chain.
Only 3.03 and 3.05 meet at 3.07; 3.04 goes to 3.06.

**Where the perturbation is actually applied:** step 3.07, inside R.
`apply_climate_perturbations` receives `precip_mean_factor` (multiplicative),
`precip_var_factor` (multiplicative) and `temp_delta` (additive °C) directly from
the twelve rows of `cst_<n>.csv`, together with `compute_pet = TRUE` — so
potential evaporation is computed there by the weather generator, and then
computed again from temperature by hydromt at step 3.09.

**`cst_<n>.csv` — one producer, two consumers that read it differently:**

| | |
|---|---|
| written by | 3.03, from the project configuration's `stress_test:` block |
| read by 3.07 | the R generator — uses **all twelve monthly values** |
| read by 3.11 | the results reducer — uses **the first row only**, i.e. January |

That asymmetry is F1. The file is correct and the generator reads it correctly;
only the results reducer under-reads it. The defect is one line in one consumer,
not a data problem.

**`weathergen_config_rlz_<m>_cst_<n>.yml` — see F6 and C29.** The R script reads
five values from it: an output directory, a filename prefix, a filename suffix,
and two transient on/off switches. Only the prefix and suffix vary between runs.
