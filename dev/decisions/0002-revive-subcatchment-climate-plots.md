Deciders: Ümit Taner
Consulted: Observation 4 investigation + correction (test/pre06 gabon run;
           plot_results.log); commit af38068 (honest-message fix that surfaced
           the dormant path); existing plot_forcing precedent (plot_map_forcing.py)
Supersedes: none
Revisions:
  - 2026-07-21: initial draft (scoping only). Proposed wiring wflow OUTPUT
    variables (extend WFLOW_VARS, emit *_subcatchment CSV columns, opt-in).
  - 2026-07-21: revised after user correction — the climate plots must use the
    climate data INPUT to wflow (the ERA5-derived forcing inmaps_historical.nc),
    not wflow output variables. Data-source mechanism reversed; the old output-
    variable approach demoted to a rejected alternative. Still proposed, no code.
  - 2026-07-21: IMPLEMENTED and accepted (test/pre06). New `src/climate_forcing.py`
    (`climate_forcing_by_subcatchment`) aggregates the gridded forcing to a
    per-subcatchment mean `(index, time)` dataset with the `P/T/EP_subcatchment`
    keys `plot_clim` expects; `src/plot_results.py` §4 now builds `ds_clim` from
    `mod.forcing.data` instead of wflow outputs; `Snakefile_model_creation`
    declares `inmaps_historical.nc` as a `plot_results` input. Unit tests in
    `tests/test_climate_forcing.py`. Verified end-to-end on the real gabon model
    (both `clim_wflow_<id>_year/month.png` render; physically sensible
    climatology). Full visual QA still occurs on the user's next WF1 run.

# ADR 0002 — Revive the subcatchment climate plots from the wflow forcing input

### Context

`src/plot_results.py` §4 draws yearly and monthly climate figures (temperature,
precipitation, potential ET) at the subcatchment scale via
`src/func_plot_signature.py::plot_clim`, which reads three series keyed
`T_subcatchment` (averaged), `P_subcatchment` and `EP_subcatchment` (summed to
period accumulations). Today it builds `ds_clim` from the wflow **output** CSV,
looking for columns literally named `P/T/EP_subcatchment`. No configuration
produces those columns, so `ds_clim` is always empty and §4 always skips. On the
gabon run this printed a misleading "less than 1 year of data" line even though
`output.csv` holds 20 years; commit `af38068` corrected the **message**.

The correct data source is the climate **input** to wflow, not its output. Those
three variables are precisely the forcing that drives the model, written by the
`add_forcing` rule into `climate_historical/wflow_data/inmaps_historical.nc`
(ERA5 in the test case). Inspection of the gabon file confirms it carries
`precip` (mm d⁻¹), `pet`, and `temp` on the model grid (time × latitude ×
longitude; 2000–2020 daily). Reading wflow *outputs* to recover P/T/PET would
make the model echo its own inputs back out — redundant, and it would perturb the
manifest-fingerprinted `output.csv`.

A precedent already exists in this repo: the `plot_forcing` rule
(`src/plot_map_forcing.py`) reads the forcing via `mod.forcing.data`, masks it
with `staticmaps["subcatchment"] >= 0`, and reduces precip/pet by sum and temp by
mean — the same variables, access path, and reduction logic `plot_clim` needs. So
the fix is to aggregate the forcing to a per-subcatchment timeseries, not to wire
any new outputs.

### Decision

We will **revive** the climate plots by sourcing P/T/EP from the wflow forcing
input and feeding them to the existing `plot_clim`:

1. In `plot_results.py`, obtain the gridded forcing from the already-instantiated
   model via `mod.forcing.data` (variables `precip`, `temp`, `pet` =
   `inmaps_historical.nc`). Declare `inmaps_historical.nc` as an explicit input of
   the `plot_results` rule so the DAG dependency is honest.
2. Reduce each variable spatially to a per-subcatchment timeseries using
   `staticmaps["subcatchment"]` (group by subcatchment id so the `index`
   dimension matches the discharge stations used elsewhere), yielding an
   `index × time` dataset. Map `precip → P_subcatchment`, `temp → T_subcatchment`,
   `pet → EP_subcatchment` so `plot_clim` stays **unchanged** (it keeps summing
   P/EP and averaging T over the resample period).
3. Keep it **default-on**: the source data already exists after `add_forcing`, and
   nothing here touches `output.csv`, so the baseline manifest is unaffected and no
   opt-in gate or config surface is needed.

The already-committed honest message in `plot_results.py` §4 remains as a guard for
the rare case the forcing cannot be read (e.g. `mod.forcing.data` empty).

### Consequences

*Positive*
- The yearly/monthly climate QA figures render by default from the actual model
  forcing — the intended, non-redundant source.
- Zero change to `output.csv`, `WFLOW_VARS`, or `setup_gauges_and_outputs` → the
  sealed discharge baseline manifest is untouched; no re-record, no opt-in gate.
- Reuses the proven `plot_forcing` access/masking pattern (`mod.forcing.data` +
  `staticmaps["subcatchment"]`), lowering implementation and review risk.

*Negative*
- `plot_results` gains a dependency on the forcing file; the rule's `input:` must
  add `inmaps_historical.nc` (and the plotting must degrade gracefully if forcing
  is absent — the existing guard message covers this).
- Per-subcatchment spatial aggregation is new code to write and test (grouping the
  forcing grid by the subcatchment map, handling the nodata mask).

*Neutral*
- Units carry from the forcing: `precip` mm d⁻¹ (summed to period totals), `pet`
  same (units attr unset in the file — assume mm d⁻¹, verify), `temp` °C
  (averaged). Matches `plot_clim`'s existing sum/mean split.
- The `ds_clim.time < 365` branch stays meaningful (short forcing → skip yearly
  plots); the "absent" branch becomes a rare fallback, not the normal path.

### Alternatives considered

- **Wire wflow OUTPUT variables** (the original draft): extend `WFLOW_VARS` with
  temperature + potential-ET CSDMS names, emit `*_subcatchment` CSV columns via
  `setup_config_output_timeseries`, opt-in/default-off. **Rejected** on the user
  correction: it makes wflow re-emit its own forcing inputs (redundant), perturbs
  the manifest-fingerprinted `output.csv` (forcing a re-record or an opt-in gate),
  and needs a `WFLOW_VARS` extension the forcing-input path avoids entirely. Would
  only be preferred if the desired series were genuine model *state/flux* outputs
  rather than input forcing.
- **Remove the dead §4 code** (and `plot_clim`). Simpler, but discards legitimate
  forcing-climatology QA the user wants; the forcing-input fix is cheap and reuses
  an existing pattern. Preferred only if the plots were judged redundant with the
  projection workflow.
- **Basin-mean instead of per-subcatchment**: aggregate the whole basin to one
  series (as `plot_forcing` does for its maps). Simpler, but loses the per-station
  `index` alignment `plot_clim` iterates; acceptable as a first cut for
  single-outlet basins, but per-subcatchment is the general form.

### Related

- `src/plot_results.py` §4 and `src/func_plot_signature.py::plot_clim` — the plot
  contract (`P/T/EP_subcatchment`).
- `src/plot_map_forcing.py::plot_forcing` — the precedent: forcing via
  `mod.forcing.data`, masking via `staticmaps["subcatchment"]`, sum/mean reduction.
- `src/setup_time_horizon.py` / `add_forcing` rule — produces
  `inmaps_historical.nc` (`precip`, `temp`, `pet`).
- Commit `af38068` — the honest-message fix that exposed this dormant path.
- Baseline manifest (`dev/scripts/check_baseline.py`; memory: baseline-manifest-*)
  — unaffected here because `output.csv` is not touched (the key win over the
  rejected output-variable approach).
