"""R07 B1: the three ``extract_historical_climate`` declarations are ONE rule.

The store producer is declared as ``extract_historical_climate`` in
``build_model.smk`` (rule 1.04) and ``run_stress_test.smk`` (rule 3.08), both
from the same ``snake_utils.climate_store_rule`` object.
``analyze_projections.smk`` declares it NOT AT ALL — ADR 0003 removed it, and
``test_wf2_declares_no_store_and_no_extraction`` is what keeps it removed.
``analyze_climate.smk`` is the third declarer but generates one rule per
candidate source rather than copying the shared one; see the block above
``_wf0_rule`` for why, and the two ``test_wf0_*`` cases for the weaker
invariant that replaces byte-identity there.

Nothing in the rule grammar enforces that the two byte-identical declarations
stay identical, and a per-workflow difference re-creates the wf1<->wf3
re-extraction oscillation the design forbids (P2(b), ext1-02/ext2-01). This
module is the enforcement: it parses the workflows in-process and compares the
**full normalized contract** — rule name, script, input set, outputs, params,
**and every content- or execution-affecting directive**.

Two properties, deliberately separate:

* ``test_ruleinfo_field_universe_is_fully_bucketed`` — DENY BY DEFAULT. Every
  field of the pinned Snakemake's ``RuleInfo`` must be classified into exactly
  one of three buckets: compared, allowed-local (``message``/``log``/
  ``benchmark`` only), or structurally-irrelevant-with-a-written-reason. A
  Snakemake upgrade that adds a directive fails HERE, loudly, instead of
  silently widening the hole. This is what makes the enumeration below a check
  on the derivation rather than its only source.
* ``test_declarations_are_identical`` — the comparison itself, over the
  **effective built-rule state**, not the source text.

``message``/``log``/``benchmark`` are the only permitted local differences: none
is content-determining and none participates in a rerun trigger (Snakemake
records the log list but compares code, input, params, mtime and software-env).
