"""R07 B1: the store's region and the built model agree on the basin.

Successor to the retired ``test_extract_climate_wf1.py``
``test_staticmaps_bbox_within_two_cells_of_region_bounds``. That test compared
the two *pre-R07* bbox derivations (``staticmaps.nc`` raster bounds vs
``staticgeoms/region.geojson``); both are now gone from the extraction path,
which delineates model-free from ``shared.basin`` + the catalog.

What survives it is the configuration-independent invariant: the store's
delineated region (``spatial/geoms/region.geojson``) and the model grid
(``staticmaps.nc``) must describe the same basin. Raster bounds are snapped
outward to the model grid, so the tolerance is 2 x model resolution per edge —
the same band the retired test used. On the seed fixture the two agree far more
tightly than that (the 2026-07-28 bounds probe put them bit-identical); the band
exists so the assertion holds for any region/resolution, not just the seed.

Fixture-gated exactly as its predecessor was: it needs a completed run under
``test_case/test_local``. One skip retired, one skip added — net zero.
