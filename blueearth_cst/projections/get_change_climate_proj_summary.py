    The string coords arrive as numpy fixed-width dtypes (`<U13`, `<U19`, …) whose
    width is set by the longest value in *that one file*. Concatenating files with
    different widths silently truncates every value to the FIRST file's width:
    `NOAA-GFDL/GFDL-ESM4` (19) became `NOAA-GFDL/GFD` (13) whenever an
    `INM/INM-CM4-8` file was merged first. Silent, because a truncated model name
    is still a plausible-looking string.

    It corrupted the wide summary's `model` coordinate, and through it the tidy
    table's `model` column — and, because the per-combination window lookup is
    keyed on that name, the truncated rows also missed their effective-window
    override and fell back to the run-level one. Found at S8-04 when the column
    read `GFD`; the truncation predates it and was already in the `dataset` column
    of the wide summary.

    Casting to object dtype makes each value independent of the others' lengths.
