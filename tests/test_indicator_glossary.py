"""`dev/reference/indicator-glossary.md` is checked against the code, not trusted.

The glossary is a fifth hand-maintained copy of the variable vocabulary, and this
repo already knows what happens to those: 8bd51de changed the csv header scheme
while the reducer's matcher kept the retired spelling, and two indicator tables
were written empty with every rule green. A prose table with no test drifts the
same way, only more quietly -- nothing runs it.

So the glossary declares itself DERIVED, and this module is what makes that true:
it parses the markdown tables and asserts they agree, row for row, with the dicts
that own each column. A failure here means the GLOSSARY is stale -- fix the
document, not the code.

Deliberately parsing the rendered markdown rather than a data file the document
is generated from: a generated glossary would be one more artifact to keep in the
tree, and the document is short enough that a table parser is cheaper than a
build step. The parser is strict about the pipe/backtick shape for that reason --
a row it cannot read fails loudly rather than being skipped.
