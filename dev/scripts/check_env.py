"""Report whether a checkout's environment can actually run the workflows.

``pixi install`` is not the whole environment, and the gap is invisible until a
run reaches the layer that is missing. This checks the three things it does
NOT guarantee, each of which has failed on its own:

1. **weathergenr.** It is installed from GitHub via ``remotes``
   (``pixi run install``), not from ``pixi.toml``, so a checkout that has only
   had ``pixi install`` looks healthy and dies at WF3's weather generator with
   ``there is no package called 'weathergenr'``.
2. **The Julia environment.** Same split — ``Pkg.instantiate()`` runs from
   ``pixi run install``. It usually passes on a second checkout because the
   depot under ``~/.julia`` is shared, which is exactly why its absence is
   surprising when it does happen.
3. **Console scripts a distribution CLAIMS but that are not on disk.**
   ``pixi install`` reconciles against its own metadata, so it neither detects
   nor repairs this, and reports success either way. Only code that SHELLS OUT
   to the executable breaks, while everything importing the module passes — a
   suite failing in one narrow layer for no visible reason; see
   ``docs/env_setup_notes.md`` for the recorded repair.

**Worktrees are the case this exists for.** Each carries its own tracked
``pixi.toml`` and therefore builds its own ``.pixi/``, so every session slot needs the
``pixi run install`` layer separately. ``--all`` checks every worktree that
``git worktree list`` knows about, which is the question actually being asked:
not "is this checkout complete" but "are they all".

Read-only: this reports, and never installs. The fix it points at is
``pixi run install`` in the checkout that failed. Exits non-zero when anything
is incomplete, so it can gate a script.

Usage (from the repo root, inside pixi)::

    python dev/scripts/check_env.py            # this checkout
    python dev/scripts/check_env.py --all      # every registered worktree
    python dev/scripts/check_env.py --root <path>

Not part of a run: this inspects a checkout (see AGENTS.md, "Three homes for
executables").
