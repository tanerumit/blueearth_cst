"""Report and optionally delete config artifacts the snapshot redesign retired.

Third sibling of ``prune_series_cache.py`` and ``prune_climate_store.py``, and
the narrowest of the three: it is a ONE-SHOT MIGRATION, not a recurring pruner.
Once a project has been brought to the new shape, this script has nothing left
to find.

**What became stale, and why nothing else reports it.** The config-snapshot
redesign (2026-08-13) removed the content-addressed bundle and replaced
bin-level copying with a per-file predicate:

- ``<project_dir>/config/runs/<workflow>/<digest>/`` bundles are no longer
  written by anything. Snakemake cannot clean a directory it no longer
  declares, so every bundle an existing project accumulated simply stays.
- ``config/templates/`` and ``config/catalogs/`` copies are now made only when
  the toolbox repository CANNOT give the file back. A copy that is
  byte-identical to a tracked toolbox file is exactly what the new predicate
  would no longer make.

**What this refuses to touch, and why each matters.**

- ``<exp_dir>/config/catalogs/`` — holds the GENERATED experiment catalog,
  written over generated forcing at run time. The design keeps it. A pattern
  match on ``config/catalogs/`` across the whole tree would delete it, which is
  why the experiment tree is excluded outright rather than filtered.
- ``config/basin_data/`` — copies of files that live outside the repository
  and outside ``project_dir``. The predicate copies them BY DESIGN: the toolbox
  cannot give them back, and losing them costs the project its record of what
  it was built and evaluated against. Named ``observations/`` until 2026-08-14;
  a pre-rename project tree keeps the old bin, which nothing here deletes.
- Anything in ``templates/`` or ``catalogs/`` that is NOT byte-identical to a
  tracked toolbox file. That is precisely the site-specific catalog R4 exists
  to protect, so it is reported and never deleted.

**Default is a dry run.** Nothing is deleted without ``--delete``, the same
contract the two sibling scripts state. Deletion here is irreversible in a way
theirs is not: a bundle is the only remaining record of a configuration a
project once ran under, and no rule will regenerate it.

Usage (from the repo root, inside pixi)::

    python dev/scripts/prune_config_snapshots.py --config test_case/project_config_baseline.yml
    python dev/scripts/prune_config_snapshots.py --config <cfg> --delete

Not part of a run: this inspects and maintains a project tree
(see AGENTS.md, "Three homes for executables").
