"""Refuse to simulate when the live model has changed since the experiment ran.

The other half of the *Model reproducibility contract*: rule 3.01c records which
model state an experiment used, and this recomputes the fingerprint and fails
loud on a mismatch **before WF3 performs any simulation work**.

**Ordering is the whole guard.** A check that runs after the work is not a
guard, it is a post-mortem: the forcing has been downscaled and the members have
run, against physics the experiment never recorded. So this rule's sentinel is
declared as an input of rule 3.09, the first rule that touches the model.

**Why the reference does not simply follow the model.** Rule 3.01c declares its
model inputs ``ancient()``, so a rebuilt model does NOT re-trigger it. That is
load-bearing rather than incidental: if the reference were rewritten whenever
the model changed, it would always match, the comparison would always pass, and
the guard would be decorative.

The failure names the changed input. A digest mismatch alone tells an operator
that something moved; it does not tell them whether the forcing was replaced or
the parameters were re-derived, and those call for different responses.
