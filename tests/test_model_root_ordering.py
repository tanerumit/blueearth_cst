"""Every WF1 rule that touches the model root is ordered after its last writer.

ADR 0004. `models/hydrology/wflow/` is a hydromt model directory: successive
`setup_*` calls rewrite it in place, so it has one DECLARED producer (rule 1.03)
and several actual writers. Snakemake attributes the files to 1.03, so a reader
that declares `staticmaps.nc` is ordered after 1.03 rather than after the rule
that writes it last.

Measured on the R9 gate run: rule 1.08 `add_climate_forcing` (`hydromt update
wflow_sbm`) rewrites the WHOLE model root, 17 s after `.outputs_configured` --
the sentinel R9 P2 F5 chose as the anchor on the belief that rule 1.05 was the
last writer. Rule 1.12 read `staticmaps.nc` and finished 9 s before 1.08
rewrote it. Nothing in the DAG produced that margin, and the failure it risks is
silent: `HDF5_USE_FILE_LOCKING="FALSE"` makes a concurrent read abort below
Python with no traceback.

So the invariant is: a rule that touches the model root either WRITES it, and is
a named member of the build chain, or READS it, and declares the terminal
sentinel `.model_final`.

**Comments are stripped before anything is matched.** Otherwise this module
would be satisfied by prose -- a rule carrying `# see .model_final` would pass
while declaring nothing, and the sweep that fixed the comment would "break" the
test. That failure is not hypothetical here; it is what R9 P5 found in
`test_cli.py`'s WF2 region guard.
