  - 2026-08-05: initial draft; raised from R9 P2 F5's unfixed root cause, and
    from the measurement below showing that F5's own fix is insufficient.
  - 2026-08-05: ACCEPTED and implemented. Two refinements from doing it, both
    narrowing the Decision as written: the sentinel is scoped to WF1 (see
    *Decision*), and 1.08 was measured to rewrite the WHOLE model root, not
    just `staticmaps.nc` and the toml, which brought rule 1.06 into scope. The
    rejected alternative's disqualifier was confirmed empirically rather than
    left as a documented expectation (see *Alternatives considered*).

### Context

hydromt's model is a **mutable directory** that successive `setup_*` calls
rewrite in place. Snakemake's model is **immutable dataflow**: a file has one
producing rule, and declaring it as an input orders you after that rule. WF1
sits on the seam, and `models/hydrology/wflow/{staticmaps.nc,wflow_sbm.toml}`
is where the two models disagree.

Both files are **created by rule 1.03** and then **rewritten in place** by rules
1.04 (`mod.write()`/`mod.close()`), 1.05 (same), and 1.08 (`hydromt update
wflow_sbm`). 1.08's write is the widest: measured on the gate run, it rewrites
`staticmaps.nc`, `wflow_sbm.toml`, `hydromt.log` **and every `staticgeoms/`
layer**, all at 22:59:37-40. Only artifacts written by our own scripts
(`outlet_index.csv`, `reservoirs_lakes_glaciers.txt`) escape it — which is why
rule 1.06, reading `staticgeoms/outlets.geojson`, is in scope too.

**Only 1.03 declares any of it.** So Snakemake attributes the files to 1.03, and
a reader that declares `staticmaps.nc` is ordered after 1.03 — not after the
last rule that writes it. The repository already works around this
with a chain of completion sentinels (`.model_built` → `reservoirs_lakes_glaciers.txt`
→ `.outputs_configured`), which is the impedance-matching layer between the two
models and is not itself the problem.

R9 P2 F5 diagnosed the consequence: rule 1.12 `plot_map` reads `staticmaps.nc`
straight off disk, declared only the gauges layer, and at `-c 3` was scheduled
concurrently with a writer. It dies with **no Python traceback** — the pixi env
sets `HDF5_USE_FILE_LOCKING = "FALSE"`, so an unprotected concurrent read aborts
below Python. F5 fixed it by anchoring 1.12 on `.outputs_configured`, rule 1.05's
sentinel, reasoning that it is "the earliest edge that means every writer of
staticmaps.nc is done".

**That reasoning is wrong, and the R9 gate run measures it.** From the fixture
tree and `benchmarks/wf1_benchmarks.md` for that `-c 3` run:

| Artifact / rule | Time |
|---|---|
| `.outputs_configured` (1.05's sentinel — the current anchor) | 22:59:20 |
| 1.12 `plot_map` outputs written (rule took 8.77 s) | 22:59:28 |
| 1.08 `add_forcing` window (rule took 12.95 s, forcing written 22:59:41) | ≈22:59:28 → 22:59:41 |
| **`staticmaps.nc` last written** | **22:59:37** |

`staticmaps.nc`'s final write falls **inside rule 1.08's window**, seventeen
seconds *after* the sentinel that is supposed to mean "all writers are done".
1.12 finished at the moment 1.08 started; the run survived on a margin of about
nine seconds, and nothing in the DAG produced that margin. 1.12 becomes runnable
when 1.05 completes, 1.08 becomes runnable when 1.07 completes, and the two are
free to overlap. A basin large enough to make 1.12 take ~18 s instead of ~9 s
puts its read on top of 1.08's write, and the failure mode is a silent abort.

So the live defect is not that 1.04's write is undeclared. It is that **with
in-place mutation the last writer is the only correct anchor, and the workflow
currently anchors on an intermediate one.** No decision means the race stays
live and the next reader inherits it, because the anchor's name
(`.outputs_configured`) reads as a completion marker for the whole model.

### Decision

We will introduce a **terminal build sentinel**, `.model_final`, declared as a
`touch()` output of the last rule that writes the model root (currently rule
1.08 `add_forcing`), and every **WF1** rule that reads a model-root artifact and
is not itself a writer will declare `ancient(.model_final)` as its ordering
edge. The scope is WF1 because the hazard is intra-DAG concurrency: WF2 and WF3
run as separate Snakemake invocations, after WF1 has finished, so no writer of
theirs is in flight. Extending the sentinel to WF3 would add a fourth
cross-workflow leaf (`cross_workflow_inputs.LEAVES`) and buy no ordering. The existing per-rule
sentinel chain is retained unchanged for ordering *within* the build; the
terminal sentinel is the single edge that means "the model directory is final".
The output declarations on rules 1.03–1.08 are **not** changed. A test asserts
that every rule reading a model-root artifact declares the terminal sentinel, so
the 1.12 defect cannot recur silently.

### Consequences

*Positive*

- The measured race closes: no reader can be scheduled before 1.08's last write,
  because the edge is produced by 1.08 itself rather than by an earlier rule.
- The correctness condition becomes checkable rather than remembered. Today a
  new reader is correct only if its author knows which of five rules writes the
  model root last; after this it is correct if it declares one named file, and a
  test says so when it does not.
- The anchor's name stops lying. `.outputs_configured` means rule 1.05 finished;
  `.model_final` means what readers actually need.

*Negative*

- A fifth sentinel in the model root, for a workflow that already has three. The
  sentinel chain grows before it shrinks, and this ADR does not reduce it.
- The terminal sentinel is only as correct as the claim "1.08 is the last
  writer". If a future rule mutates the model root after 1.08, the sentinel must
  move with it. The enforcing test cannot detect that — it checks that readers
  declare the sentinel, not that the sentinel is attached to the last writer.
  **This is the residual risk and it should be stated in the Snakefile comment.**
- Readers gain an edge they did not have, so the DAG changes shape. Measured
  with `dev/scripts/rule_dag_levels.py` on a fresh project at `-c 3`: `plot_map`
  moves from depth 5 to 7 and `write_outlet_index` from 3 to 7, so both now sit
  strictly behind `add_forcing` at 6 instead of beside or ahead of it. Job count
  is unchanged at 18. Any recorded DAG render is stale.

**Verified on a real run** (2026-08-05, `-c 3`, fresh `project_dir`, 18/18
steps): `.model_final` is written at 21:46:15, alongside 1.08's last model
writes, and every reader lands after it — `plot_map` 21:46:28,
`write_outlet_index` 21:46:32, `run_wflow` 21:47:55. The same run reproduces
the defect it fixes: `staticmaps.nc` is last written at 21:46:11, **19 s after**
`.outputs_configured` at 21:45:52, matching the 17 s measured on the gate run.
So the old anchor was not a one-off misreading, and the ordering is now
inverted: `plot_map` finishes 13 s *after* the last model write instead of 9 s
before it.

*Neutral*

- `dev/scripts/semantic_tree_diff.py` needs **no** path-map row, which is the
  opposite of what this ADR first said. That list is pre-R09 -> post-R09
  RELOCATION and `.model_final` has no pre-R09 form, so a row could never fire;
  the file records the reason in place of the row. What the sentinel does cause
  is one EXTRA in a whole-tree diff against a pre-ADR-0004 reference, passed via
  `--allow models/hydrology/wflow/.model_final` (the r09 milestone has no
  `build_r09_allowlist`; extras go on the command line).
- Related, and worth stating because it was tried: `--check-map` does NOT
  validate a post-ADR-0004 tree. It implements the R9 observed-tier runbook,
  whose input is a PRE-R9 tree being migrated, so every relocated path in a
  post-R9 tree falls through as UNMAPPED by design — `.model_built` and
  `.outputs_configured` included. It is not a regression check for new
  artifacts.
- **No baseline re-record.** Sentinels are not `rule all` targets and are not
  fingerprinted by `check_baseline.py`; no artifact's content changes. This
  corrects the initial sizing of this item, which assumed a re-record.
- Rule numbering is untouched, so `naming.md` §9's stable-identifier rule and
  the `LOG_RULES` labels are unaffected.

### Alternatives considered

**Move the output declaration to the last writer.** Declare `staticmaps.nc` and
`wflow_sbm.toml` as outputs of 1.08 rather than 1.03, and drop the
`ancient(staticmaps.nc)` inputs on 1.04/1.05 (which would otherwise form a
cycle). Readers could then declare the files plainly and be ordered correctly by
Snakemake with no sentinel at all — the honest dataflow answer, and the one the
F5 write-up proposed.

Not chosen because it inverts Snakemake's failure semantics against us:
**Snakemake deletes a failed job's declared outputs** (absent
`--keep-incomplete`), so a transient failure in 1.08 — a network hiccup in
`hydromt update`, a bad forcing catalog entry — would delete the built model and
force a full rebuild from 1.03. Today a failed 1.08 leaves the model intact
because the model is 1.03's output. Trading a race for "a flaky forcing step
destroys an hour of build" is not an improvement. It would be preferred if 1.08
were made atomic (write to a temp model root, promote on success), which is a
larger change and its own decision. *This disqualifier rests on Snakemake's
documented delete-on-failure behaviour and should be confirmed empirically
before the alternative is revisited.*

**Collapse the model mutators into one rule.** Merge 1.04, 1.05 and 1.08's model
updates so a single rule owns the model root and declares it honestly. Rejected
on three counts: it destroys the per-rule log and benchmark granularity R3
deliberately introduced (each rule owns a `logs/_parts/` entry and a benchmark
row); rule numbers are stable identifiers per `naming.md` §9 and appear in
`LOG_RULES`, log paths and prose, so a merge renumbers a contract surface; and it
fights hydromt's staged `setup_*` model, which AGENTS.md's hard constraint
forbids re-engineering. It would be preferred if the three steps were ever found
to be inseparable for correctness rather than merely adjacent.

**Do nothing and document the hazard.** Add a comment naming `.outputs_configured`
as the anchor and move on. Rejected: the measurement above shows that anchor is
already insufficient, so documenting it would propagate the wrong rule. This is
the status quo and it is what the ADR exists to end.
