"""`C-37` — every declared config key reaches a reader, and it fails closed.

The clean run on today's tree is the least interesting assertion here. What has
to be shown is that the check CAN fire, and — the whole reason `D-14.5` exists —
that it says so when it cannot see one of its two sides instead of reporting a
clean bill it has no basis for.

The failure mode is not hypothetical. R14's own register re-measure was run
twice because the first pass's ground-truth extraction silently returned zero
keys, and the pass then reported MORE problems while knowing LESS.
