"""Which indicator tables a WF3 experiment emits, derived from ``wflow_outvars``.

CR-2 splits the response-surface results into **one table per output variable**
instead of the two fixed tables (``q_indicators.csv`` + ``basin_indicators.csv``)
that preceded it. The set is therefore config-dependent, and four places need to
agree on it before any of them can run:

- ``run_stress_test.smk`` — ``WF3_TARGETS`` and rule 3.16's ``output:``,
  at DAG-construction time;
- ``blueearth_cst/experiment/export_wflow_results.py`` — what it writes, and the
  ``variable`` half of each composite ``metric``;
- ``blueearth_cst/shared/interchange_contracts.py`` — HM-7's per-table checks;
- ``dev/scripts/check_baseline.py`` and ``semantic_tree_diff.py`` — the target
  list and the path map.

Runtime discovery is not an option for the first of those. The pre-CR-2 writer
found its variables by reading the wflow run CSV's own columns
(``[x for x in sim.columns if "basavg" in x]``), which cannot work when Snakemake
needs the output paths *before* any rule has produced a CSV to inspect.

**The tokens are a third spelling, and that is the accepted cost.** Alongside the
CSDMS names (``river_water__volume_flow_rate``) and the Tier 2 display labels,
these short tokens exist because a composite metric built from snake-cased
semantic names would read ``actual_evapotranspiration_annual_total`` — which
undercuts the readability that motivated composing the name at all. CR-2 places
this mapping in the seam contract for that reason: it is a contract, not an
implementation detail.

The rule for minting future tokens, so they are not chosen ad hoc: **where the
repo already has a canonical short name, use it; only mint where none exists; and
disambiguate against names already in use.** Its four consequences are why
``precip`` is not ``p`` (``naming.md`` §6 tier 2 declares ``precip`` canonical, and
``p`` would be a seventh spelling), why ``aet`` is not ``et`` (``pet`` is already
canonical here and one letter apart in the same file is a misreading waiting to
happen), why ``snow`` is not ``swe`` (the CSDMS name is
``snowpack_liquid_water__depth`` — snowpack *liquid water*, not total water
equivalent, so minting ``swe`` would assert a physical claim upstream does not
make, which ``AGENTS.md`` puts out of scope), and — since 2026-08-11 — why
groundwater recharge is ``gwr`` rather than ``recharge``: ``gwr`` is the code
``wflow_outputs.CODES`` already writes into the TOML and therefore into every
run csv header, so the first clause of the rule applies and ``recharge`` was the
violation. That rename is the one case where the rule *removed* a spelling
instead of choosing between two new ones; see ``OUTPUT_CODES`` below, where the
token and the code now coincide for this variable.

The published table of all of these, one row per variable and one column per
spelling, is ``dev/reference/indicator-glossary.md``. It is DERIVED from the
dicts here and in ``wflow_outputs`` — ``tests/test_indicator_glossary.py`` parses
it and fails when the two disagree — so extend the dicts first and the glossary
second, never the reverse.

from blueearth_cst.shared.wflow_outputs import CODES as _WFLOW_CODES

#: Semantic name (as it appears in ``workflows.build_model.wflow_outvars``)
#: → short token used in filenames and in the composite ``metric``.
#:
#: Authoritative source for the semantic names: the ``WFLOW_VARS`` map in
#: ``dev/reference/workflows/model_creation.md``. **Six entries, not five** —
#: ``precipitation`` is one of them, emitted at registry locations with header
#: ``P`` when a ``location_registry`` is configured.
VARIABLE_TOKENS = {
    "river discharge": "q",
    "precipitation": "precip",
    "actual evapotranspiration": "aet",
    "groundwater recharge": "gwr",
    "overland flow": "overland_flow",
    "snow": "snow",
}

#: Indicator token → the CODE that variable's columns carry in a wflow run csv.
#:
#: **A fourth spelling, and unlike the other three it is not ours to choose.** The
#: code is `wflow_outputs.CODES`, which reaches the csv header via the TOML the
#: model build writes (``gwr_101``, ``aet_101``); the token is what this file
#: mints for filenames and metric names. Three of the five still differ —
#: ``precip`` is ``p``, ``snow`` is ``swe``, ``overland_flow`` is ``qof`` — so a
#: reducer that reuses the token as the column prefix reads exactly the two where
#: they coincide (``aet``, ``gwr``) and silently finds nothing for the rest.
#: **Two agreeing tokens is worse than one for a naive fix**, not better: it
#: doubles the chance that whichever variable a hand-written test reaches for is
#: one the broken matcher happens to work on.
#:
#: DERIVED from the two tables rather than hand-written, because a third
#: hand-maintained copy of the variable list is how this drifted in the first
#: place: 8bd51de changed the header scheme and the reducer's own matcher kept
#: looking for the retired ``<label>_basavg`` spelling, which emptied
#: ``aet_indicators.csv`` and ``recharge_indicators.csv`` (as the recharge table
#: was then named — it is ``gwr_indicators.csv`` since 2026-08-11) with the run
#: green. Both
#: tables are keyed by the SEMANTIC LABEL a config writes, which is what lets them
#: be joined here; a label in one and not the other raises at import.
OUTPUT_CODES = {VARIABLE_TOKENS[label]: code for label, code in _WFLOW_CODES.items()}

#: Filename suffix shared by every indicator table. ``q_indicators.csv`` keeps the
#: name it was given in R9, which is why the pattern is token-first.
_TABLE_SUFFIX = "_indicators.csv"

#: The five columns of every indicator table, in order. Fixed regardless of gauge
#: count — that fixity is the point of the long shape — and, since the axis
#: columns were removed, fixed regardless of the STRESS-dimension count too.
#:
#: Lives here rather than in the writer because BOTH the writer and ``validate_hm7``
#: need it, and ``shared/`` may not import from ``experiment/``. Stating it once is
#: also what stops the producer and its validator disagreeing about the header,
#: which is the specific failure this pairing exists to prevent.
#:
#: **Ordered identifier-first, owner ruling 2026-08-11.** The columns read *what*
#: (``metric``, ``location``), then *which member* (``st_id``, ``rlz_id``), then
#: the number. ``realization_id`` became ``rlz_id`` in the same ruling, matching
#: the ``rlz_`` member token already carried by the run filenames
#: (``rlz_1_st_0.csv``) and by ``RLZ_NUM``.
#:
#: **``temp_change`` and ``precip_change`` were REMOVED**, and the removal is the
#: point rather than a simplification. They held a month-length-weighted ANNUAL
#: mean of the member's twelve monthly perturbations, taken at reduction time,
#: which misreports any seasonal design: +30% imposed in JJA is
#: ``(92*1.30 + 273*1.00)/365`` = +7.6% on the axis. Baking one collapse into the
#: results also made every other axis unrecoverable from them. The axis is now
#: DERIVED at reporting time from ``stress_test_lookup.csv``; the specification is
#: HM-7 and the reference implementation is ``shared/surface_axes.py``.
INDICATOR_COLUMNS = (
    "metric",
    "location",
    "st_id",
    "rlz_id",
    "value",
)

#: ``rlz_id`` for a pooled row. A numeric sentinel in a numeric key column is safe
#: ONLY because no metric emits both grains; if that ever changes it must become a
#: string, or ``groupby("rlz_id")`` folds pooled rows in as another realization.
POOLED_REALIZATION = 0

#: The reserved ``location`` for a basin-scalar value (Q11, 2026-08-07): emitted
#: independently rather than derived from per-location values, because whether
#: subcatchments nest or tile decides whether an area-weighted mean is even valid.
#:
#: **Reserved, and currently unemitted.** Since 8bd51de the model's csv columns are
#: per-subcatchment means (``map = "subcatchment"``), so no whole-basin column
#: exists in a run to carry this value — the reducer emits one row per subcatchment
#: id, exactly as it does per gauge. Q11 is why it stays that way rather than being
#: area-weighted into a basin row here: filling this constant needs a whole-basin
#: column declared in the TOML, which is a WF1 change, not a reduction one.
BASIN_LOCATION = "basin"


#: Discharge metrics: internal statistic key → (metric suffix, grain class).
#:
#: The suffix is composed systematically rather than borrowed from conventional
#: hydrological shorthand, because two of ours differ from the established
#: meaning: our ``q95`` is the mean annual 95th percentile (a HIGH flow), while
#: conventional *Q95* is the flow exceeded 95% of the time (a LOW-flow drought
#: index) — opposite ends of the distribution. Hence ``_p95``. Verbose beats
#: wrong.
#:
#: ``mean_annual_`` is not padding: it says "annual statistic, then mean over
#: years", which the pre-R11 names hid.
#:
#: **"Return level", not "return interval" or "return period" — the distinction is
#: real, not pedantry.** The *return period* is the input ``T`` (years); the
#: *return level* is what comes back, a discharge magnitude, which is what this
#: row's ``value`` holds. Naming the metric after the period would name the wrong
#: quantity. "Return interval" is additionally non-standard: the established
#: synonyms are *return period* (engineering, extreme-value theory) and
#: *recurrence interval* (USGS usage) — the two the knowledge base's
#: ``hydrological-indicators`` note uses throughout. The statistic keys below were
#: renamed off the inherited ``returninterval`` spelling for that reason.
#:
#: Return periods, in years, that the two GEV return-level indicators are
#: evaluated at. **Toolbox constants since 2026-08-12, not config values.**
#:
#: They were the ``Tpeak`` / ``Tlow`` keys of ``workflows.run_stress_test``
#: until then, and the owner retired them from the project config: a return
#: period is a property of the indicator set this toolbox defines, and indicator
#: definitions live here rather than in a per-project scaffold. Both keys shipped
#: at these values in every config the repo carried, so retiring them changed no
#: emitted name and no number.
#:
#: A project that genuinely needs a different design standard changes them here,
#: which is a toolbox edit and re-names two indicators — deliberately visible,
#: rather than a per-project knob that silently redefines what a column means.
RETURN_PERIOD_PEAK_YR = 10
RETURN_PERIOD_LOW_YR = 2

#: The two return levels still carry their return period in the NAME, which is
#: the property R11 bought: before it, two runs at different periods produced
#: identical-looking rows meaning different things — a 10-year and a 20-year
#: flood level, indistinguishable once the file left the project folder. The
#: period is no longer a config value (see :data:`RETURN_PERIOD_PEAK_YR`), so
#: the vocabulary is now a fixed enumeration rather than a pattern.
#:
#: Grain classes (CR-2): **A** is emitted per realization, **B** and **C** only
#: pooled (``rlz_id = 0``). See ``METRIC_CLASSES``.

#: Basin-scalar variables: token → (metric suffix, annual reduction).
#:
#: Ruled 2026-08-08 (Q10 scope + metric naming). Two things worth reading
#: together, because they are why this table is not uniform:
#:
#: 1. **Overland flow reduces with a MEAN, not a sum.** It is a volume flow rate
#:    (m³ s⁻¹), so summing daily values produces a quantity in no unit anyone
#:    wants; the annual mean preserves the native unit. ET, recharge and
#:    precipitation keep ``annual_total`` in mm/yr — a daily sum of a mm Δt⁻¹
#:    flux is a legitimate time-integral, which is precisely why overland flow
#:    was the odd one out. Scoped deliberately to overland flow: reporting ET as
#:    mm/day instead would rescale it by 365 and is not what a water-balance
#:    reader expects.
#: 2. **The suffixes omit the ``mean_`` prefix** the q vocabulary uses
#:    (``snow_annual_max``, not ``snow_mean_annual_max``), by owner ruling
#:    2026-08-08. **Accepted asymmetry, recorded so a reader does not read it as
#:    a bug:** ``q_mean_annual_max`` and ``snow_annual_max`` describe the same
#:    reduction shape — annual statistic, then mean over years — spelled two
#:    ways. The q vocabulary makes the mean-over-years step visible; these do not.

#:
#: Refused rather than ignored, per the ``variable_spec.parse`` precedent. The
#: hazard is specific to this repo's config handling: **workflow configs silently
#: ignore keys nothing reads**, so a retired key does not fail, does not warn, and
#: does not take effect — it leaves a user believing a setting is in force while
#: it does nothing. A refusal that states the migration is strictly better than a
#: setting that lies.
#:
#: **Registering a retirement here is not optional.** It was, in effect, until
#: 2026-08-12: ``Tpeak``/``Tlow`` were removed from every config and from the
#: reader without an entry, so for the length of one commit a project declaring
#: ``Tpeak: 25`` got exactly the silent no-op this registry exists to prevent.
#: Nothing catches the omission — the removal itself makes the key unread, which
#: is indistinguishable from it never having existed. The obligation is on
#: whoever retires the key.
#:
#: The migration note is PER ENTRY rather than one module constant, because

#: ``existing_results`` answers the ONE question the experiment freeze needs and

#:   run cannot continue; it is re-run as a new one. ``aggregate_rlz`` is this:

#:   something else.
#: * ``"unchanged"`` — the removal was value-preserving, so the recorded results
#:   are still exactly what they were. ``Tpeak``/``Tlow`` are this: both shipped at
#:   the values that became the constants, so no emitted name or number moved.
#:
#: A key with no entry here counts as ``"redefined"``. That default is the point:
#: forgetting to register a retirement must fail loud, exactly as
