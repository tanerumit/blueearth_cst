"""Canonical climate figures for the wflow FORCING (rule 1.12).

The model-grid half of the pair:
``models/hydrology/wflow/forcing/inmaps_historical.nc``
is the same climate as the shared store's extraction, after the build's regrid,
lapse/pressure corrections and PET derivation. Drawing it with the SAME figure
set as the source grid (``climate_analysis.climate_figures``) is what makes
"what did the downscaling change?" answerable by putting two directories side by
side, which is why this module is now a thin caller rather than a plotter.

This module owns only what is model-specific: loading the model, masking to the
basin, and handing over the basin/river geometries as map overlays.

Two things changed with the canonical set (2026-08), both deliberate:

* **No more cartopy basemap tiles.** The previous ``plot_map_model`` called
  ``cartopy.io.img_tiles.QuadtreeTiles``, i.e. a live tile request in the middle
  of WF1. Rule 1.12 now needs no NETWORK. The basin/river context it bought is
  drawn from the model's own geometries instead. Rule 1.11's ``basin_area``
  dropped the same tiles in 2026-08 for the same reason plus two more —
  licence/attribution on a submitted figure, and a basemap that the server can
  re-render out from under a "reproducible" run — so NO rule in WF1 fetches
  tiles any more. It draws its terrain context as a hillshade of the model's own
  DEM (``shared.cartographic_map``), which is offline, reproducible, and finer
  tiles were at the zoom level that rule had hardcoded.
* **Filenames carry the dataset.** ``precip.png`` became
  ``forcing_precip_map.png`` and friends — see ``climate_figures.figure_names``.

    ----------
    wflow_root : str | Path
        The wflow model root (``models/hydrology/wflow/``).
    plot_dir : str | Path, optional
        Destination. Defaults to ``<wflow_root>/plots``; rule 1.12 passes
        ``models/hydrology/wflow/forcing/plots`` so the figures sit beside the
        forcing they describe (R07 B10).
    gauges_fn : str | Path, optional
        Retained for the rule's signature; the map overlays no longer come from
        the model's own gauge layer (see ``geoms_dir``).
    geoms_dir : str | Path, optional
