"""Two-layer tests for the interchange-contract validators (design §5.5).

- **Layer 1 — synthetic pass/fail, fixture-independent, ALWAYS executed.**
  Every validator ships a conforming in-memory object (report == []) and a
  deliberately broken one (report != []). No file I/O — objects are built
  directly here (the validators take parsed objects, never paths), so a
  fixtureless checkout (fresh clone, CI) still executes every validator's pass
  AND fail path. "Green" is never indistinguishable from "nothing checked".

- **Layer 2 — real-fixture integration, skipped VISIBLY when the fixture is
  absent.** Each case opens an artifact under the untracked ``test_case/test_local``
  tree and carries the repo fixture-absent guard (mirroring
  ``tests/test_store_region_bbox.py``): a module-level ``_FIXTURE_ABSENT``
  reason constant + ``@pytest.mark.skipif``. Absence is a NAMED, reported
  condition (read via ``pytest -rs``), never silence. The three temp() content
  validators (WG-4/WG-6/HM-6b) additionally skip with a documented reason when
  the temp artifact is absent (the default fixture state) — see the commit-4
  temp layer.

seam docs ``dev/reference/contracts/*-seam.md``.

# compared the migrated tree against (`dev/milestones/r14/config-shape-gate5.md`)

# --- temp() content integration cases — doubly skip-guarded (commit-4) ------
#
# Each carries BOTH the fixture-absent skipif (Layer-2 convention) AND a
# temp-absent runtime skip with the documented reason, since the temp()
# artifact is deleted after its consumer finishes and is absent on the default
# fixture. The ``--notemp`` capture procedure (both seam docs' validator
# indexes) un-skips these on disk without a design change.

_TEMP_ABSENT = "temp() artifact absent; capture via --notemp"

# Fixture temp() paths (present only after a --notemp capture run). R9 P2 also
# flattened the member naming here: the rlz_<r>/ directory level dissolved and
# the index went back into the stem, so these are `inmaps_rlz_1_st_1.nc`, not
# `rlz_1/forcing/inmaps_st_1.nc`. Unlike the persisted cases above these fail
# SILENTLY when stale -- the runtime `os.path.exists` guard reads a wrong path as
# "temp artifact absent" and skips, so a stale path here is indistinguishable
# from a normal run. That is why they are derived from the same roots. R11 P2's
# `cst_` -> `st_` rename is a second reason they read absent today; unlike the
# persisted cases it needs no `_member_artifact` guard, because these skip on
# the default fixture either way.
